{"text": "Jim Gilmore came to Hortons Bay from Canada. He bought the blacksmith\nshop from old man Horton. Jim was short and dark with big mustaches\nand big hands. He was a good horseshoer and did not look much like a\nblacksmith even with his leather apron on. He lived upstairs above\nthe blacksmith shop and took his meals at A. J. Smith’s.\n\nLiz Coates worked for Smith’s. Mrs. Smith, who was a very large clean\nwoman, said Liz Coates was the neatest girl she’d ever seen. Liz had\ngood legs and always wore clean gingham aprons and Jim noticed that\nher hair was always neat behind. He liked her face because it was so\njolly but he never thought about her.\n\nLiz liked Jim very much. She liked it the way he walked over from the\nshop and often went to the kitchen door to watch for him to start\ndown the road. She liked it about his mustache. She liked it about\nhow white his teeth were when he smiled. She liked it very much that\nhe didn’t look like a blacksmith. She liked it how much A. J. Smith\nand Mrs. Smith liked Jim. One day she found that she liked it the way\nthe hair was black on his arms and how white they were above the\ntanned line when he washed up in the washbasin outside the house.\nLiking that made her feel funny.\n\nHortons Bay, the town, was only five houses on the main road between\nBoyne City and Charlevoix. There was the general store and postoffice\nwith a high false front and maybe a wagon hitched out in front,\nSmith’s house, Stroud’s house, Fox’s house, Horton’s house and Van\nHoosen’s house. The houses were in a big grove of elm trees and the\nroad was very sandy. There was farming country and timber each way up\nthe road. Up the road a ways was the Methodist church and down the\nroad the other direction was the township school. The blacksmith shop\nwas painted red and faced the school.\n\nA steep sandy road ran down the hill to the bay through the timber.\nFrom Smith’s back door you could look out across the woods that ran\ndown to the lake and across the bay. It was very beautiful in the\nspring and summer, the bay blue and bright and usually whitecaps on\nthe lake out beyond the point from the breeze blowing from Charlevoix\nand Lake Michigan. From Smith’s back door Liz could see ore barges\nway out in the lake going toward Boyne City. When she looked at them\nthey didn’t seem to be moving at all but if she went in and dried\nsome more dishes and then came out again they would be out of sight\nbeyond the point.\n\nAll the time now Liz was thinking about Jim Gilmore. He didn’t seem\nto notice her much. He talked about the shop to A. J. Smith and about\nthe Republican Party and about James G. Blaine. In the evenings he\nread the Toledo Blade and the Grand Rapids paper by the lamp in the\nfront room or went out spearing fish in the bay with a jacklight with\nA. J. Smith. In the fall he and Smith and Charley Wyman took a wagon\nand tent, grub, axes, their rifles and two dogs and went on a trip to\nthe pine plains beyond Vanderbilt deer hunting. Liz and Mrs. Smith\nwere cooking for four days for them before they started. Liz wanted\nto make something special for Jim to take but she didn’t finally\nbecause she was afraid to ask Mrs. Smith for the eggs and flour and\nafraid if she bought them Mrs. Smith would catch her cooking. It\nwould have been all right with Mrs. Smith but Liz was afraid."}
{"text": "All the time Jim was gone on the deer hunting trip Liz thought about\nhim. It was awful while he was gone. She couldn’t sleep well from\nthinking about him but she discovered it was fun to think about him\ntoo. If she let herself go it was better. The night before they were\nto come back she didn’t sleep at all, that is she didn’t think she\nslept because it was all mixed up in a dream about not sleeping and\nreally not sleeping. When she saw the wagon coming down the road she\nfelt weak and sick sort of inside. She couldn’t wait till she saw Jim\nand it seemed as though everything would be all right when he came.\nThe wagon stopped outside under the big elm and Mrs. Smith and Liz\nwent out. All the men had beards and there were three deer in the\nback of the wagon, their thin legs sticking stiff over the edge of\nthe wagon box. Mrs. Smith kissed Alonzo and he hugged her. Jim said\n“Hello Liz.” and grinned. Liz hadn’t known just what would happen\nwhen Jim got back but she was sure it would be something. Nothing had\nhappened. The men were just home that was all. Jim pulled the burlap\nsacks off the deer and Liz looked at them. One was a big buck. It was\nstiff and hard to lift out of the wagon.\n\n“Did you shoot it Jim?” Liz asked.\n\n“Yeah. Aint it a beauty?” Jim got it onto his back to carry to the\nsmokehouse.\n\nThat night Charley Wyman stayed to supper at Smith’s. It was too late\nto get back to Charlevoix. The men washed up and waited in the front\nroom for supper.\n\n“Aint there something left in that crock Jimmy?” A. J. Smith asked\nand Jim went out to the wagon in the barn and fetched in the jug of\nwhiskey the men had taken hunting with them. It was a four gallon jug\nand there was quite a little slopped back and forth in the bottom.\nJim took a long pull on his way back to the house. It was hard to\nlift such a big jug up to drink out of it. Some of the whiskey ran\ndown on his shirt front. The two men smiled when Jim came in with the\njug. A. J. Smith sent for glasses and Liz brought them. A. J. poured\nout three big shots.\n\n“Well here’s looking at you A. J.” said Charley Wyman.\n\n“That damn big buck Jimmy.” said A. J.\n\n“Here’s all the ones we missed A. J.” said Jim and downed his liquor.\n\n“Tastes good to a man.”\n\n“Nothing like it this time of year for what ails you.”\n\n“How about another boys?”\n\n“Here’s how A. J.”\n\n“Down the creek boys.”\n\n“Here’s to next year.”\n\nJim began to feel great. He loved the taste and the feel of whisky.\nHe was glad to be back to a comfortable bed and warm food and the\nshop. He had another drink. The men came in to supper feeling\nhilarious but acting very respectable. Liz sat at the table after she\nput on the food and ate with the family. It was a good dinner. The\nmen ate seriously. After supper they went into the front room again\nand Liz cleaned off with Mrs. Smith. Then Mrs. Smith went up stairs\nand pretty soon Smith came out and went up stairs too. Jim and\nCharley were still in the front room. Liz was sitting in the kitchen\nnext to the stove pretending to read a book and thinking about Jim.\nShe didn’t want to go to bed yet because she knew Jim would be coming\nout and she wanted to see him as he went out so she could take the\nway he looked up to bed with her.\n\nShe was thinking about him hard and then Jim came out. His eyes were\nshining and his hair was a little rumpled. Liz looked down at her\nbook. Jim came over back of her chair and stood there and she could\nfeel him breathing and then he put his arms around her. Her breasts\nfelt plump and firm and the nipples were erect under his hands. Liz\nwas terribly frightened, no one had ever touched her, but she\nthought, “He’s come to me finally. He’s really come.”"}
{"text": "She held herself stiff because she was so frightened and did not know\nanything else to do and then Jim held her tight against the chair and\nkissed her. It was such a sharp, aching, hurting feeling that she\nthought she couldn’t stand it. She felt Jim right through the back of\nthe chair and she couldn’t stand it and then something clicked inside\nof her and the feeling was warmer and softer. Jim held her tight hard\nagainst the chair and she wanted it now and Jim whispered, “Come on\nfor a walk.”\n\nLiz took her coat off the peg on the kitchen wall and they went out\nthe door. Jim had his arm around her and every little way they\nstopped and pressed against each other and Jim kissed her. There was\nno moon and they walked ankle deep in the sandy road through the\ntrees down to the dock and the warehouse on the bay. The water was\nlapping in the piles and the point was dark across the bay. It was\ncold but Liz was hot all over from being with Jim. They sat down in\nthe shelter of the warehouse and Jim pulled Liz close to him. She was\nfrightened. One of Jim’s hands went inside her dress and stroked over\nher breast and the other hand was in her lap. She was very frightened\nand didn’t know how he was going to go about things but she snuggled\nclose to him. Then the hand that felt so big in her lap went away and\nwas on her leg and started to move up it.\n\n“Don’t Jim”. Liz said. Jim slid the hand further up.\n\n“You musn’t Jim. You musn’t”. Neither Jim nor Jim’s big hand paid any\nattention to her.\n\nThe boards were hard. Jim had her dress up and was trying to do\nsomething to her. She was frightened but she wanted it. She had to\nhave it but it frightened her.\n\n“You musn’t do it Jim. You musn’t.”\n\n“I got to. I’m going to. You know we got to.”\n\n“No we haven’t Jim. We aint got to. Oh it isn’t right. Oh it’s so big\nand it hurts so. You can’t. Oh Jim. Jim. Oh.”\n\nThe hemlock planks of the dock were hard and splintery and cold and\nJim was heavy on her and he had hurt her. Liz pushed him, she was so\nuncomfortable and cramped. Jim was asleep. He wouldn’t move. She\nworked out from under him and sat up and straightened her skirt and\ncoat and tried to do something with her hair. Jim was sleeping with\nhis mouth a little open. Liz leaned over and kissed him on the cheek.\nHe was still asleep. She lifted his head a little and shook it. He\nrolled his head over and swallowed. Liz started to cry. She walked\nover to the edge of the dock and looked down to the water. There was\na mist coming up from the bay. She was cold and miserable and\neverything felt gone. She walked back to where Jim was lying and\nshook him once more to make sure. She was crying.\n\n“Jim” she said, “Jim. Please Jim”.\n\nJim stirred and curled a little tighter. Liz took off her coat and\nleaned over and covered him with it. She tucked it around him neatly\nand carefully. Then she walked across the dock and up the steep sandy\nroad to go to bed. A cold mist was coming up through the woods from\nthe bay.\n\nOn the four lira he had earned by spading the hotel garden he got\nquite drunk. He saw the young gentleman coming down the path and\nspoke to him mysteriously. The young gentleman said he had not eaten\nyet but would be ready to go as soon as lunch was finished. Forty\nminutes or an hour.\n\nAt the cantina near the bridge they trusted him for three more\ngrappas because he was so confident and mysterious about his job for\nthe afternoon. It was a windy day with the sun coming out from behind\nclouds and then going under in sprinkles of rain. A wonderful day for\ntrout fishing."}
{"text": "The young gentleman came out of the hotel and asked him about the\nrods. Should his wife come behind with the rods? Yes, said Peduzzi,\nlet her follow us. The young gentleman went back into the hotel and\nspoke to his wife. He and Peduzzi started down the road. The young\ngentleman had a musette over his shoulder. Peduzzi saw the wife, who\nlooked as young as the young gentleman and was wearing mountain boots\nand a blue beret, start out to follow them down the road carrying the\nfishing rods unjointed one in each hand. Peduzzi didn’t like her to\nbe way back there. Signorina, he called, winking at the young\ngentleman, come up here and walk with us. Signora come up here. Let\nus all walk together. Peduzzi wanted them all three to walk down the\nstreet of Cortina together.\n\nThe wife stayed behind, following rather sullenly. Signorina, Peduzzi\ncalled tenderly, come up here with us. The young gentleman looked\nback and shouted something. The wife stopped lagging behind, and\nwalked up.\n\nEveryone they met walking through the main street of the town Peduzzi\ngreeted elaborately. _Buon’ di Arturo!_ Tipping his hat. The bank\nclerk stared at him from the door of the Fascist café. Groups of\nthree and four people standing in front of the shops stared at the\nthree. The workmen in their stone-powdered jackets working on the\nfoundations of the new hotel looked up as they passed. Nobody spoke\nor gave any sign to them except the town beggar, lean and old with a\nspittle thickened beard, who lifted his hat as they passed.\n\nPeduzzi stopped in front of a store with the window full of bottles\nand brought his empty grappa bottle from an inside pocket of his old\nmilitary coat. A little to drink, some marsala for the Signora,\nsomething, something to drink. He gestured with the bottle. It was a\nwonderful day. Marsala, you like marsala, Signorina? A little\nmarsala?\n\nThe wife stood sullenly. You’ll have to play up to this, she said. I\ncan’t understand a word he says. He’s drunk isn’t he?\n\nThe young gentleman appeared not to hear Peduzzi. He was thinking\nwhat in hell makes him say Marsala. That’s what Max Beerbohm drinks.\n\n_Geld,_ Peduzzi said finally, taking hold of the young gentleman’s\nsleeve. _Lire._ He smiled reluctant to press the subject but needing\nto bring the young gentleman into action.\n\nThe young gentleman took out his pocket book and gave him a ten lire\nnote. Peduzzi went up the steps to the door of the Speciality of\nDomestic and Foreign Wines shop. It was locked.\n\nIt is closed until two, someone passing in the street said\nscornfully. Peduzzi came down the steps. He felt hurt. Never mind, he\nsaid, we can get it at the Concordia.\n\nThey walked down the road to the Concordia three abreast. On the\nporch of the Concordia where the rusty bobsleds were stacked the\nyoung gentleman said, _Was wollen sie?_ Peduzzi handed him the ten\nlira note folded over and over. Nothing, he said, Anything. He was\nembarrassed. Marsala maybe. I don’t know. Marsala?\n\nThe door of the Concordia shut on the young gentleman and the wife.\nThree marsalas, said the y. g. to the girl behind the pastry counter.\nTwo you mean? she asked. No, he said, one for a _vecchio._ Oh, she\nsaid, a _vecchio,_ and laughed getting down the bottle. She poured\nout the three muddy looking drinks into three glasses. The wife was\nsitting at a table under the line of newspapers on sticks. The y. g.\nput one of the marsalas in front of her. You might as well drink it,\nhe said. Maybe it’ll make you feel better. She sat and looked at the\nglass. The y. g. went outside the door with a glass for Peduzzi but\ncould not see him.\n\nI don’t know where he is, he said coming back into the pastry room\ncarrying the glass.\n\nHe wanted a quart of it, said the wife.\n\nHow much is a quarter litre, the y. g. asked the girl.\n\nOf the bianco? One lira.\n\nNo, of the marsala. Put these two in too, he said giving her his own\nglass and the one poured for Peduzzi. She filled the quarter litre\nwine measure with a funnel. A bottle to carry it, said the y. g.\n\nShe went to hunt for a bottle. It all amused her."}
{"text": "I’m sorry you feel so rotten Tiny, he said, I’m sorry I talked the\nway I did at lunch. We were both getting at the same thing from\ndifferent angles.\n\nIt doesn’t make any difference, she said. None of it makes any\ndifference.\n\nAre you too cold, he asked. I wish you’d worn another sweater.\n\nI’ve got on three sweaters.\n\nThe girl came in with a very slim brown bottle and poured the marsala\ninto it. The y. g. paid five lira more. They went out of the door.\nThe girl was amused. Peduzzi was walking up and down at the other end\nout of the wind and holding the rods.\n\nCome on, he said, I will carry the rods. What difference does it make\nif anybody sees them. No one will trouble us. No one will make any\ntrouble for me in Cortina. I know them at the _municipio._ I have\nbeen a soldier. Everybody in this town likes me. I sell frogs. What\nif it is forbidden to fish? Not a thing. Nothing. No trouble. Big\ntrout I tell you. Lots of them.\n\nThey were walking down the hill toward the river. The town was in\nback of them. The sun had gone under and it was sprinkling rain.\nThere, said Peduzzi, pointing to a girl in the doorway of a house\nthey passed. My daughter.\n\nHis doctor, the wife said, has he got to show us his doctor?\n\nHe said his daughter, said the y. g.\n\nThe girl went into the house as Peduzzi pointed.\n\nThey walked down the hill across the fields and then turned to follow\nthe river bank. Peduzzi talked rapidly with much winking and\nknowingness. As they walked three abreast the wife caught his breath\nacross the wind. Once he nudged her in the ribs. Part of the time he\ntalked in D’Ampezzo dialect and sometimes in Tyroler German dialect.\nHe could not make out which the young gentleman and his wife\nunderstood the best so he was being bi-lingual. But as the young\ngentleman said _Ja Ja_ Peduzzi decided to talk altogether in Tyroler.\nThe young gentleman and the wife understood nothing.\n\nEverybody in the town saw us going through with these rods. We’re\nprobably being followed by the game police now. I wish we weren’t in\non this damn thing. This damned old fool is so drunk too.\n\nOf course you haven’t got the guts to just go back, said the wife. Of\ncourse you have to go on.\n\nWhy don’t you go back? Go on back Tiny.\n\nI’m going to stay with you. If you go to jail we might as well both\ngo.\n\nThey turned sharp down the bank and Peduzzi stood his coat blowing in\nthe wind gesturing at the river. It was brown and muddy. Off on the\nright there was a dump heap.\n\nSay it to me in Italian, said the young gentleman\n\n_Un’ mezz’ ora. Piu d’ un’ mezz’ ora._\n\nHe says it’s at least a half an hour more. Go on back Tiny. You’re\ncold in this wind anyway. It’s a rotten day and we aren’t going to\nhave any fun anyway.\n\nAll right, she said, and climbed up the grassy bank.\n\nPeduzzi was down at the river and did not notice her till she was\nalmost out of sight over the crest. Frau! he shouted. Frau! Fraulein!\nYou’re not going? She went on over the crest of the hill.\n\nShe’s gone! said Peduzzi. It shocked him.\n\nHe took off the rubber bands that held the rod segments together and\ncommenced to joint up one of the rods.\n\nBut you said it was half an hour further.\n\nOh yes. It is good half an hour down. It is good here too.\n\nReally?\n\nOf course. It is good here and good there too.\n\nThe y. g. sat down on the bank and jointed up a rod, put on the reel\nand threaded the line through the guides. He felt uncomfortable and\nafraid that any minute a gamekeeper or a posse of citizens would come\nover the bank from the town. He could see the houses of the town and\nthe campanile over the edge of the hill. He opened his leader box.\nPeduzzi leaned over and dug his flat hard thumb and forefinger in and\ntangled the moistened leaders.\n\nHave you some lead?\n\nNo.\n\nYou must have some lead. Peduzzi was excited. You must have _piombo.\nPiombo._ A little _piombo._ Just here. Just above the hook or your\nbait will float on the water. You must have it. Just a little\n_piombo._\n\nHave you got some?\n\nNo. He looked through all his pockets desperately. Sifting through\nthe cloth dirt in the linings of his inside military pockets. I\nhaven’t any. We must have _piombo._"}
{"text": "We can’t fish then, said the y. g. and unjointed the rod, reeling the\nline back through the guides. We’ll get some _piombo_ and fish\ntomorrow.\n\nBut listen _caro,_ you must have _piombo._ The line will lie flat on\nthe water. Peduzzi’s day was going to pieces before his eyes. You\nmust have _piombo._ A little is enough. Your stuff is all clean and\nnew but you have no lead. I would have brought some. You said you had\neverything.\n\nThe y. g. looked at the stream discoloured by the melting snow. I\nknow, he said, we’ll get some _piombo_ and fish tomorrow.\n\nAt what hour in the morning? Tell me that.\n\nAt seven.\n\nThe sun came out. It was warm and pleasant. The young gentleman felt\nrelieved. He was no longer breaking the law. Sitting on the bank he\ntook the bottle of marsala out of his pocket and passed it to\nPeduzzi. Peduzzi passed it back. The y. g. took a drink of it and\npassed it to Peduzzi again. Peduzzi passed it back again. Drink, he\nsaid, drink. It’s your marsala. After another short drink the y. g.\nhanded the bottle over. Peduzzi had been watching it closely. He took\nthe bottle very hurriedly and tipped it up. The grey hairs in the\nfolds of his neck oscillated as he drank his eyes fixed on the end of\nthe narrow brown bottle. He drank it all. The sun shone while he\ndrank. It was wonderful. This was a great day after all. A wonderful\nday.\n\n_Senta caro!_ In the morning at seven. He had called the young\ngentleman _caro_ several times and nothing had happened. It was good\nmarsala. His eyes glistened. Days like this stretched out ahead. It\nwould begin again at seven in the morning.\n\nThey started to walk up the hill toward the town. The y. g. went on\nahead. He was quite a way up the hill. Peduzzi called to him.\n\nListen _caro_ can you let me take five lira for a favour?\n\nFor today? asked the young gentleman frowning.\n\nNo, not today. Give it to me today for tomorrow. I will provide\neverything for tomorrow. _Pane, salami, formaggio,_ good stuff for\nall of us. You and I and the signora. Bait for fishing, minnows, not\nworms only. Perhaps I can get some marsala. All for five lira. Five\nlira for a favour.\n\nThe young gentleman looked through his pocket book and took out a two\nlira note and two ones.\n\nThank you _caro_. Thank you, said Peduzzi in the tone of one member\nof the Carleton Club accepting the Morning Post from another. This\nwas living. He was through with the hotel garden, breaking up frozen\nmanure with a dung fork. Life was opening out.\n\nUntil seven o’clock then _caro,_ he said, slapping the y. g. on the\nback. Promptly at seven.\n\nI may not be going, said the young gentleman putting his purse back\nin his pocket.\n\nWhat, said Peduzzi. I will have minnows Signor. _Salami,_ everything.\nYou and I and the Signora. The three of us.\n\nI may not be going, said the y. g., very probably not. I will leave\nword with the padrone at the hotel office.\n\nI guess looking at it now my old man was cut out for a fat guy, one\nof those regular little roly fat guys you see around, but he sure\nnever got that way, except a little toward the last, and then it\nwasn’t his fault, he was riding over the jumps only and he could\nafford to carry plenty of weight then. I remember the way he’d pull\non a rubber shirt over a couple of jerseys and a big sweat shirt over\nthat and get me to run with him in the forenoon in the hot sun. He’d\nhave maybe taken a trial trip with one of Razzo’s skins early in the\nmorning after just getting in from Torino at four o’clock in the\nmorning and beating it out to the stables in a cab and then with the\ndew all over everything and the sun just starting to get going I’d\nhelp him pull off his boots and he’d get into a pair of sneakers and\nall these sweaters and we’d start out.\n\n“Come on kid” he’d say, stepping up and down on his toes in front of\nthe jock’s dressing room, “let’s get moving”."}
{"text": "Then we’d start off jogging around the infield once maybe with him\nahead running nice and then turn out the gate and along one of those\nroads with all the trees along both sides of them that run out from\nSan Siro. I’d go ahead of him when we hit the road and I could run\npretty stout and I’d look around and he’d be jogging easy just behind\nme and after a little while I’d look around again and he’d begun to\nsweat. Sweating heavy and he’d just be dogging it along with his eyes\non my back, but when he’d catch me looking at him he’d grin and say,\n“Sweating plenty?” When my old man grinned nobody could help but grin\ntoo. We’d keep right on running out toward the mountains and then my\nold man would yell “Hey Joe!” and I’d look back and he’d be sitting\nunder a tree with a towel he’d had around his waist wrapped around\nhis neck.\n\nI’d come back and sit down beside him and he’d pull a rope out of his\npocket and start skipping rope out in the sun with the sweat pouring\noff his face and him skipping rope out in the white dust with the\nrope going cloppetty cloppety clop clop clop and the sun hotter and\nhim working harder up and down a patch of the road. Say it was a\ntreat to see my old man skip rope too. He could whirr it fast or lop\nit slow and fancy. Say you ought to have seen wops look at us\nsometimes when they’d come by going into town walking along with big\nwhite steers hauling the cart. They sure looked as though they\nthought the old man was nuts. He’d start the rope whirring till\nthey’d stop dead still and watch him, then give the steers a cluck\nand a poke with the goad and get going again.\n\nWhen I’d sit watching him working out in the hot sun I sure felt fond\nof him. He sure was fun and he done his work so hard and he’d finish\nup with a regular whirring that’d drive the sweat out on his face\nlike water and then sling the rope at the tree and come over and sit\ndown with me and lean back against the tree with the towel and a\nsweater wrapped around his neck.\n\n“Sure is hell keeping it down, Joe” he’d say and lean back and shut\nhis eyes and breath long and deep, “it aint like when you’re a kid”.\nThen he’d get up before he started to cool and we’d jog along back to\nthe stables. That’s the way it was keeping down to weight. He was\nworried all the time. Most jocks can just about ride off all they\nwant to. A jock loses about a kilo every time he rides, but my old\nman was sort of dried out and he couldn’t keep down his kilos without\nall that running.\n\nI remember once at San Siro, Regoli, a little wop that was riding for\nBuzoni came out across the paddock going to the bar for something\ncool and flicking his boots with his whip, after he’d just weighed in\nand my old man had just weighed in too and came out with the saddle\nunder his arm looking red faced and tired and too big for his silks\nand he stood there looking at young Regoli standing up to the\noutdoors bar cool and kid looking and I says, “What’s the matter\nDad?” cause I thought maybe Regoli had bumped him or something and he\njust looked at Regoli and said, “Oh to hell with it” and went on to\nthe dressing room.\n\nWell it would have been all right maybe if we’d stayed in Milan and\nridden at Milan and Torino cause if there ever were any easy courses\nits those two. “Pianola, Joe”. My old man said when he dismounted in\nthe winning stall after what the wops thought was a hell of a\nsteeplechase. I asked him once, “This course rides its-self. It’s the\npace you’re going at that makes riding the jumps dangerous Joe. We\naint going any pace here, and they aint any really bad jumps either.\nBut it’s the pace always—not the jumps that makes the trouble”.\n\nSan Siro was the swellest course I’d ever seen but the old man said\nit was a dog’s life. Going back and forth between Mirafiore and San\nSiro and riding just about every day in the week with a train ride\nevery other night."}
{"text": "I was nuts about the horses too. There’s something about it when they\ncome out and go up the track to the post. Sort of dancy and tight\nlooking with the jock keeping a tight hold on them and maybe easing\noff a little and letting them run a little going up. Then once they\nwere at the barrier it got me worse than anything. Especially at San\nSiro with that big green infield and the mountains way off and the\nfat wop starter with his big whip and the jocks fiddling them around\nand then the barrier snapping up and that bell going off and them all\ngetting off in a bunch and then commencing to string out. You know\nthe way a bunch of skins gets off. If you’re up in the stand with a\npair of glasses all you see is them plunging off and then that bell\ngoes off and it seems like it rings for a thousand years and then\nthey come sweeping round the turn. There wasn’t ever anything like it\nfor me.\n\nBut my old man said one day in the dressing room when he was getting\ninto his street clothes, “None of these things are horses Joe. They’d\nkill that bunch of skates for their hides and hoofs up at Paris”.\nThat was the day he’d won the Premio Commercio with Lantorna shooting\nher out of the field the last hundred meters like pulling a cork out\nof a bottle.\n\nIt was right after the Premio Commercio that we pulled out and left\nItaly. My old man and Holbrook and a fat wop in a straw hat that kept\nwiping his face with a handkerchief were having an argument at a\ntable in the Galleria. They were all talking French and the two of\nthem were after my old man about something. Finally he didn’t say\nanything any more but just sat there and looked at Holbrook and the\ntwo of them kept after him, first one talking and then the other and\nthe fat wop always butting in on Holbrook.\n\n“You go out and buy me a Sportsman, will you Joe?” my old man said\nand handed me a couple of _soldi_ without looking away from Holbrook.\n\nSo I went out of the Galleria and walked over to in front of the\nScala and bought a paper and came back and stood a little way away\nbecause I didn’t want to butt in and my old man was sitting back in\nhis chair looking down at his coffee and fooling with a spoon and\nHolbrook and the big wop were standing and the big wop was wiping his\nface and shaking his head. And I came up and my old man acted just as\nthough the two of them weren’t standing there and said, “Want an ice\nJoe?” Holbrook looked down at my old man and said slow and careful,\n“You son of a bitch” and he and the fat wop went out through the\ntables.\n\nMy old man sat there and sort of smiled at me but his face was white\nand he looked sick as hell and I was scared and felt sick inside\nbecause I knew something had happened and I didn’t see how anybody\ncould call my old man a son of a bitch and get away with it. My old\nman opened up the Sportsman and studied the handicaps for a while and\nthen he said, “You got to take a lot of things in this world Joe”.\nAnd three days later we left Milan for good on the Turin train for\nParis after an auction sale out in front of Turner’s stables of\neverything we couldn’t get into a trunk and a suit case."}
{"text": "We got into Paris early in the morning in a long dirty station the\nold man told me was the Gare de Lyon. Paris was an awful big town\nafter Milan. Seems like in Milan everybody is going somewhere and all\nthe trams run somewhere and there aint any sort of a mixup, but Paris\nis all balled up and they never do straighten it out. I got to like\nit though, part of it anyway, and say it’s got the best race courses\nin the world. Seems as though that were the thing that keeps it all\ngoing and about the only thing you can figure on is that every day\nthe buses will be going out to whatever track they’re running at\ngoing right out through everything to the track. I never really got\nto know Paris well because I just came in about once or twice a week\nwith the old man from Maisons and he always sat at the Cafe de la\nPaix on the Opera side with the rest of the gang from Maisons and I\nguess that’s one of the busiest parts of the town. But say it is\nfunny that a big town like Paris wouldn’t have a Galleria isn’t it?\n\nWell, we went out to live at Maisons-Lafitte, where just about\neverybody lives except the gang at Chantilly, with a Mrs. Meyers that\nruns a boarding house. Maisons is about the swellest place to live\nI’ve ever seen in all my life. The town aint so much, but there’s a\nlake and a swell forest that we used to go off bumming in all day, a\ncouple of us kids, and my old man made me a sling shot and we got a\nlot of things with it but the best one was a magpie. Young Dick\nAtkinson shot a rabbit with it one day and we put it under a tree and\nwere all sitting around and Dick had some cigarettes and all of a\nsudden the rabbit jumped up and beat it into the brush and we chased\nit but we couldn’t find it. Gee we had fun at Maisons. Mrs. Meyers\nused to give me lunch in the morning and I’d be gone all day. I\nlearned to talk French quick. It’s an easy language.\n\nWe went out to wherever they were running every day with the car from\nMaisons and that was the most fun of all. I was glad when the horses\ncame back from Deauville and the summer. Even though it meant no more\nbumming in the woods, cause then we’d ride to Enghien or Tremblay or\nSt. Cloud and watch them from the trainers’ and jockeys’ stand. I\nsure learned about racing from going out with that gang and the fun\nof it was going every day.\n\nI remember once out at St. Cloud. It was a big two hundred thousand\nfranc race with seven entries and Kzar a big favourite. I went around\nto the paddock to see the horses with my old man and you never saw\nsuch horses. This Kzar is a great big yellow horse that looks like\njust nothing but run. I never saw such a horse. He was being led\naround the paddock with his head down and when he went by me I felt\nall hollow inside he was so beautiful. There never was such a\nwonderful, lean, running built horse. And he went around the paddock\nputting his feet just so and quiet and careful and moving easy like\nhe knew just what he had to do and not jerking and standing up on his\nlegs and getting wild eyed like you see these selling platers with a\nshot of dope in them. The crowd was so thick I couldn’t see him again\nexcept just his legs going by and some yellow and my old man started\nout through the crowd and I followed him over to the jock’s dressing\nroom back in the trees and there was a big crowd around there too but\nthe man at the door in a derby nodded to my old man and we got in and\neverybody was sitting around and getting dressed and pulling shirts\nover their heads and pulling boots on and it all smelled hot and\nsweaty and linimenty and outside was the crowd looking in.\n\nThe old man went over and sat down beside George Gardner that was\ngetting into his pants and said, “What’s the dope George?” just in an\nordinary tone of voice cause there aint any use him feeling around\nbecause George either can tell him or he can’t tell him.\n\n“He won’t win” George says very low, leaning over and buttoning the\nbottoms of his pants.\n\n“Who will” my old man says leaning over close so nobody can hear.\n\n“Kircubbin” George says, “And if he does, save me a couple of\ntickets”."}
{"text": "My old man says something in a regular voice to George and George\nsays, “Don’t ever bet on anything I tell you” kidding like and we\nbeat it out and through all the crowd that was looking in over to the\n100 franc mutuel machine. But I knew something big was up because\nGeorge is Kzar’s jockey. On the way he gets one of the yellow odds\nsheets with the starting prices on and Kzar is only paying 5 for 10,\nCefisidote is next at 3 to I and fifth down the list this Kircubbin\nat 8 to 1. My old man bets five thousand on Kircubbin to win and puts\non a thousand to place and we went around back of the grandstand to\ngo up the stairs and get a place to watch the race.\n\nWe were jammed in tight and first a man in a long coat with a grey\ntall hat and a whip folded up in his hand came out and then one after\nanother the horses, with the jocks up and a stable boy holding the\nbridle on each side and walking along, followed the old guy. That big\nyellow horse Kzar came first. He didn’t look so big when you first\nlooked at him until you saw the length of his legs and the whole way\nhe’s built and the way he moves. Gosh I never saw such a horse.\nGeorge Gardner was riding him and they moved along slow, back of the\nold guy in the gray tall hat that walked along like he was the ring\nmaster in a circus. Back of Kzar, moving along smooth and yellow in\nthe sun, was a good looking black with a nice head with Tommy\nArchibald riding him and after the black was a string of five more\nhorses all moving along slow in a procession past the grandstand and\nthe pesage. My old man said the black was Kircubbin and I took a good\nlook at him and he was a nice looking horse all right but nothing\nlike Kzar.\n\nEverybody cheered Kzar when he went by and he sure was one swell\nlooking horse. The procession of them went around on the other side\npast the pelouse and then back up to the near end of the course and\nthe circus master had the stable boys turn them loose one after\nanother so they could gallop by the stands on their way up to the\npost and let everybody have a good look at them. They weren’t at the\npost hardly any time at all when the gong started and you could see\nthem way off across the infield all in a bunch starting on the first\nswing like a lot of little toy horses. I was watching them through\nthe glasses and Kzar was running well back with one of the bays\nmaking the pace. They swept down and around and came pounding past\nand Kzar was way back when they passed us and this Kircubbin horse in\nfront and going smooth. Gee it’s awful when they go by you and then\nyou have to watch them go farther away and get smaller and smaller\nand then all bunched up on the turns and then come around towards\ninto the stretch and you feel like swearing and goddaming worse and\nworse. Finally they made the last turn and came into the straightaway\nwith this Kircubbin horse way out in front. Everybody was looking\nfunny and saying “Kzar” in sort of a sick way and they pounding\nnearer down the stretch, and then something came out of the pack\nright into my glasses like a horse-headed yellow streak and everybody\nbegan to yell “Kzar” as though they were crazy. Kzar came on faster\nthan I’d ever seen anything in my life and pulled up on Kircubbin\nthat was going fast as any black horse could go with the jock\nflogging hell out of him with the gad and they were right dead neck\nand neck for a second but Kzar seemed going about twice as fast with\nthose great jumps and that head out—but it was while they were neck\nand neck that they passed the winning post and when the numbers went\nup in the slots the first one was 2 and that meant Kircubbin had won.\n\nI felt all trembly and funny inside, and then we were all jammed in\nwith the people going down stairs to stand in front of the board\nwhere they’d post what Kircubbin paid. Honest watching the race I’d\nforgot how much my old man had bet on Kircubbin. I’d wanted Kzar to\nwin so damned bad. But now it was all over it was swell to know we\nhad the winner.\n\n“Wasn’t it a swell race Dad?” I said to him."}
{"text": "He looked at me sort of funny with his derby on the back of his head,\n“George Gardner’s a swell jockey all right”, he said, “It sure took a\ngreat jock to keep that Kzar horse from winning”.\n\nOf course I knew it was funny all the time. But my old man saying\nthat right out like that sure took the kick all out of it for me and\nI didn’t get the real kick back again ever, even when they posted the\nnumbers up on the board and the bell rang to pay off and we saw that\nKircubbin paid 67.50 for 10. All around people were saying “Poor\nKzar. Poor Kzar!” And I thought, I wish I were a jockey and could\nhave rode him instead of that son of a bitch. And that was funny,\nthinking of George Gardner as a son of a bitch because I’d always\nliked him and besides he’d given us the winner, but I guess that’s\nwhat he is all right.\n\nMy old man had a big lot of money after that race and he took to\ncoming into Paris oftener. If they raced at Tremblay he’d have them\ndrop him in town on their way back to Maisons and he and I’d sit out\nin front of the Café de la Paix and watch the people go by. It’s\nfunny sitting there. There’s streams of people going by and all sorts\nof guys come up and want to sell you things and I loved to sit there\nwith my old man. That was when we’d have the most fun. Guys would\ncome by selling funny rabbits that jumped if you squeezed a bulb and\nthey’d come up to us and my old man would kid with them. He could\ntalk French just like English and all those kind of guys knew him\ncause you can always tell a jockey—and then we always sat at the same\ntable and they got used to seeing us there. There were guys selling\nmatrimonial papers and girls selling rubber eggs that when you\nsqueezed them a rooster came out of them and one old wormy looking\nguy that went by with post cards of Paris showing them to everybody,\nand of course nobody ever bought any and then he would come back and\nshow the under side of the pack and they would all be smutty post\ncards and lots of people would dig down and buy them.\n\nGee I remember the funny people that used to go by. Girls around\nsupper time looking for somebody to take them out to eat and they’d\nspeak to my old man and he’d make some joke at them in French and\nthey’d pat me on the head and go on. Once there was an American woman\nsitting with her kid daughter at the next table to us and they were\nboth eating ices and I kept looking at the girl and she was awfully\ngood looking and I smiled at her and she smiled at me but that was\nall that ever came of it because I looked for her mother and her\nevery day and I made up ways that I was going to speak to her and I\nwondered if I got to know her if her mother would let me take her out\nto Auteuil or Tremblay but I never saw either of them again. Anyway I\nguess it wouldn’t have been any good anyway because looking back on\nit I remember the way I thought out would be best to speak to her was\nto say, “Pardon me, but perhaps I can give you a winner at Enghien\ntoday?” and after all maybe she would have thought I was a tout\ninstead of really trying to give her a winner.\n\nWe’d sit at the Café de la Paix, my old man and me, and we had a big\ndrag with the waiter because my old man drank whisky and it cost five\nfrancs and that meant a good tip when the saucers were counted up. My\nold man was drinking more than I’d ever seen him, but he wasn’t\nriding at all now and besides he said that whiskey kept his weight\ndown. But I noticed he was putting it on all right just the same.\nHe’d busted away from his old gang out at Maisons and seemed to like\njust sitting around on the boulevard with me. But he was dropping\nmoney every day at the track. He’d feel sort of doleful after the\nlast race, if he’d lost on the day, until we’d get to our table and\nhe’d have his first whiskey and then he’d be fine."}
{"text": "He’d be reading the Paris-Sport and he’d look over at me and say,\n“Where’s your girl Joe?” to kid me on account I had told him about\nthe girl that day at the next table. And I’d get red but I liked\nbeing kidded about her. It gave me a good feeling. “Keep your eye\npeeled for her Joe.” he’d say, “She’ll be back.”\n\nHe’d ask me questions about things and some of the things I’d say\nhe’d laugh. And then he’d get started talking about things. About\nriding down in Egypt, or at St. Moritz on the ice before my mother\ndied, and about during the war when they had regular races down in\nthe south of France without any purses, or betting or crowd or\nanything just to keep the breed up. Regular races with the jocks\nriding hell out of the horses. Gee I could listen to my old man talk\nby the hour, especially when he’d had a couple or so of drinks. He’d\ntell me about when he was a boy in Kentucky and going coon hunting\nand the old days in the states before everything went on the bum\nthere. And he’d say, “Joe, when we’ve got a decent stake, you’re\ngoing back there to the States and go to school.”\n\n“What’ve I got to go back there to go to school for when everything’s\non the bum there?” I’d ask him.\n\n“That’s different.” he’d say and get the waiter over and pay the pile\nof saucers and we’d get a taxi to the Gare St. Lazare and get on the\ntrain out to Maisons.\n\nOne day at Auteuil after a selling steeplechase my old man bought in\nthe winner for 30.000 francs. He had to bid a little to get him but\nthe stable let the horse go finally and my old man had his permit and\nhis colors in a week. Gee I felt proud when my old man was an owner.\nHe fixed it up for stable space with Charles Drake and cut out coming\nin to Paris and started his running and sweating out again and him\nand I were the whole stable gang. Our horse’s name was Gillford, he\nwas Irish bred and a nice sweet jumper. My old man figured that\ntraining him and riding him himself he was a good investment. I was\nproud of everything and I thought Gillford was as good a horse as\nKzar. He was a good solid jumper a bay, with plenty of speed on the\nflat if you asked him for it and he was a nice looking horse too.\n\nGee I was fond of him. The first time he started with my old man up\nhe finished third in a 2.500 meter hurdle race and when my old man\ngot off him, all sweating and happy in the place stall and went in to\nweigh I felt as proud of him as though it was the first race he’d\never placed in. You see when a guy aint been riding for a long time\nyou can’t make yourself really believe that he has ever rode. The\nwhole thing was different now cause down in Milan even big races\nnever seemed to make any difference to my old man, if he won he\nwasn’t ever excited or anything, and now it was so I couldn’t hardly\nsleep the night before a race and I knew my old man was excited too\neven if he didn’t show it. Riding for yourself makes an awful\ndifference."}
{"text": "Second time Gillford and my old man started was a rainy Sunday at\nAuteuil in the Prix du Marat, a 4.500 meter steeplechase. As soon as\nhe’d gone out I beat it up in the stand with the new glasses my old\nman had bought for me to watch them. They started way over at the far\nend of the course and there was some trouble at the barrier.\nSomething with goggle blinders on was making a great fuss and rearing\naround and busted the barrier once but I could see my old man in our\nblack jacket with a white cross and a black cap sitting up on\nGillford and patting him with his hand. Then they were off in a jump\nand out of sight behind the trees and the gong going for dear life\nand the pari mutuel wickets rattling down. Gosh I was so excited I\nwas afraid to look at them but I fixed the glasses on the place where\nthey would come out back of the trees and then out they came with the\nold black jacket going third and they all sailing over the jump like\nbirds. Then they went out of sight again and then they came pounding\nout and down the hill and all going nice and sweet and easy and\ntaking the fence smooth in a bunch and moving away from us all solid.\nLooked as though you could walk across on their backs they were all\nso bunched and going so smooth, Then they bellied over the big double\nBullfinch and something came down. I couldn’t see who it was but in a\nminute the horse was up an galloping free and the field, all bunched\nstill, sweeping around the long left turn into the straightaway. They\njumped the stone wall and came jammed down the stretch toward the big\nwater jump right in front of the stands. I saw them coming and\nhollered at my old man as he went by and he was leading by about a\nlength and riding way out over and light as a monkey and they were\nracing for the water jump. They took off over the big hedge of the\nwater jump in a pack and then there was a crash and two horses pulled\nsideways out off it and kept on going and three others were piled up.\nI couldn’t see my old man anywhere. One horse knee-ed himself up and\nthe jock had hold of the bridle and mounted and went slamming on\nafter the place money. The other horse was up and away by himself,\njerking his head and galloping with the bridle rein hanging and the\njock staggered over to one side of the track against the fence. Then\nGillford rolled over to one side off my old man and got up and\nstarted to run on three legs with his off hoof dangling and there was\nmy old man lying there on the grass flat out with his face up and\nblood all over the side of his head. I ran down the stand and bumped\ninto a jam of people and got to the rail and a cop grabbed me and\nheld me and two big stretcher bearers were going out after my old man\nand around on the other side of the course I saw three horses, strung\nway out, coming out of the trees and taking the jump.\n\nMy old man was dead when they brought him in and while a doctor was\nlistening to his heart with a thing plugged in his ears I heard a\nshot up the track that meant they’d killed Gillford. I lay down\nbeside my old man when they carried the stretcher into the hospital\nroom and hung onto the stretcher and cried and cried and he looked so\nwhite and gone and so awfully dead and I couldn’t help feeling that\nif my old man was dead maybe they didn’t need to have shot Gillford.\nHis hoof might have got well. I don’t know. I loved my old man so\nmuch.\n\nThen a couple of guys came in and one of them patted me on the back\nand then went over and looked at my old man and then pulled a sheet\noff the cot and and spread it over him; and the other was telephoning\nin French for them to send the ambulance to take him out to Maisons.\nAnd I couldn’t stop crying, crying and choking, sort of, and George\nGardner came in and sat down beside me on the floor and put his arm\naround me and says, “Come on Joe old boy. Get up and we’ll go out and\nwait for the ambulance.”"}
{"text": "George and I went out to the gate and I was trying to stop bawling\nand George wiped off my face with his handkerchief and we were\nstanding back a little ways while the crowd was going out of the gate\nand a couple of guys stopped near us while we were waiting for the\ncrowd to get through the gate and one of them was counting a bunch of\nmutuel tickets and he said, “Well Butler got his all right.”\n\nThe other guy said, “I don’t give a good goddam if he did, the crook.\nHe had it coming to him on the stuff he’s pulled.”\n\n“I’ll say he had,” said the other guy and tore the bunch of tickets\nin two.\n\nAnd George Gardner looked at me to see if I’d heard and I had all\nright and he said, “Don’t you listen to what those bums said Joe.\nYour old man was one swell guy.”\n\nBut I don’t know.

The whole battery was drunk going along the road\nin the dark. We were going to the Champagne.

Oh, I am so soused.” We went along the road all\nnight in the dark and the adjutant kept riding up alongside my\nkitchen and saying, “You must put it out. It is dangerous.

He tried five times and the\ncrowd was quiet because it was a good bull and it looked like him or\nthe bull and then he finally made it. He sat down in the sand and\npuked and they held a cape over him while the crowd hollered and\nthrew things down into the bull ring.\n\nchapter 3\n\nMinarets stuck up in the rain out of Adrianople across the mud flats.\nThe carts were jammed for thirty miles along the Karagatch road.\nWater buffalo and cattle were hauling carts through the mud.

They tried to get over it, and we potted them\nfrom forty yards. They rushed it, and officers came out alone and\nworked on it. It was an absolutely perfect obstacle. Their officers\nwere very fine. We were frightfully put out when we heard the flank\nhad gone, and we had to fall back.\n\nchapter 6"}

There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard.\nIt rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut.\nOne of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him\ndownstairs and out into the rain. They tried to hold him up against\nthe wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood\nvery quietly against the wall. Finally the officer told the soldiers\nit was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first\nvolley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.\n\nchapter 7\n\nNick sat against the wall of the church where they had dragged him to\nbe clear of machine gun fire in the street. Both legs stuck out\nawkwardly. He had been hit in the spine. His face was sweaty and\ndirty. The sun shone on his face. The day was very hot. Rinaldi, big\nbacked, his equipment sprawling, lay face downward against the wall.\nNick looked straight ahead brilliantly. The pink wall of the house\nopposite had fallen out from the roof, and an iron bedstead hung\ntwisted toward the street. Two Austrian dead lay in the rubble in the\nshade of the house. Up the street were other dead. Things were\ngetting forward in the town. It was going well. Stretcher bearers\nwould be along any time now. Nick turned his head carefully and\nlooked down at Rinaldi. “Senta Rinaldi. Senta. You and me we’ve made\na separate peace.” Rinaldi lay still in the sun breathing with\ndifficulty. “Not patriots.” Nick turned his head carefully away\nsmiling sweatily. Rinaldi was a disappointing audience.\n\nchapter 8\n\nWhile the bombardment was knocking the trench to pieces at Fossalta,\nhe lay very flat and sweated and prayed oh jesus christ get me out of\nhere. Dear jesus please get me out. Christ please please please\nchrist. If you’ll only keep me from getting killed I’ll do anything\nyou say. I believe in you and I’ll tell everyone in the world that\nyou are the only thing that matters. Please please dear jesus. The\nshelling moved further up the line. We went to work on the trench and\nin the morning the sun came up and the day was hot and muggy and\ncheerful and quiet. The next night back at Mestre he did not tell the\ngirl he went upstairs with at the Villa Rossa about Jesus. And he\nnever told anybody.\n\nchapter 9\n\nAt two o’clock in the morning two Hungarians got into a cigar store\nat Fifteenth Street and Grand Avenue. Drevitts and Boyle drove up\nfrom the Fifteenth Street police station in a Ford. The Hungarians\nwere backing their wagon out of an alley. Boyle shot one off the seat\nof the wagon and one out of the wagon box. Drevetts got frightened\nwhen he found they were both dead. Hell Jimmy, he said, you oughtn’t\nto have done it. There’s liable to be a hell of a lot of trouble.\n\nWops, said Boyle, I can tell wops a mile off.\n\nchapter 10\n\nOne hot evening in Milan they carried him up onto the roof and he\ncould look out over the top of the town. There were chimney swifts in\nthe sky. After a while it got dark and the searchlights came out. The\nothers went down and took the bottles with them. He and Ag could hear\nthem below on the balcony. Ag sat on the bed. She was cool and fresh\nin the hot night.\n\nAg stayed on night duty for three months. They were glad to let her.\nWhen they operated on him she prepared him for the operating table,\nand they had a joke about friend or enema. He went under the\nanæsthetic holding tight on to himself so that he would not blab\nabout anything during the silly, talky time. After he got on crutches\nhe used to take the temperature so Ag would not have to get up from\nthe bed. There were only a few patients, and they all knew about it.\nThey all liked Ag. As he walked back along the halls he thought of Ag\nin his bed."}
{"text": "Before he went back to the front they went into the Duomo and prayed.\nIt was dim and quiet, and there were other people praying. They\nwanted to get married, but there was not enough time for the banns,\nand neither of them had birth certificates. They felt as though they\nwere married, but they wanted everyone to knew about it, and to make\nit so they could not lose it.\n\nAg wrote him many letters that he never got until after the\narmistice. Fifteen came in a bunch and he sorted them by the dates\nand read them all straight through. They were about the hospital, and\nhow much she loved him and how it was impossible to get along without\nhim and how terrible it was missing him at night.\n\nAfter the armistice they agreed he should go home to get a job so\nthey might be married. Ag would not come home until he had a good job\nand could come to New York to meet her. It was understood he would\nnot drink, and he did not want to see his friends or anyone in the\nStates. Only to get a job and be married. On the train from Padova to\nMilan they quarrelled about her not being willing to come home at\nonce. When they had to say good-bye in the station at Padova they\nkissed good-bye, but were not finished with the quarrel. He felt sick\nabout saying good-bye like that.\n\nHe went to America on a boat from Genoa. Ag went back to Torre di\nMosta to open a hospital. It was lonely and rainy there, and there\nwas a battalion of _arditi_ quartered in the town. Living in the\nmuddy, rainy town in the winter the major of the battalion made love\nto Ag, and she had never known Italians before, and finally wrote a\nletter to the States that theirs had been only a boy and girl affair.\nShe was sorry, and she knew he would probably not be able to\nunderstand, but might some day forgive her, and be grateful to her,\nand she expected, absolutely unexpectedly, to be married in the\nspring. She loved him as always, but she realized now it was only a\nboy and girl love. She hoped he would have a great career, and\nbelieved in him absolutely. She knew it was for the best.\n\nThe Major did not marry her in the spring, or any other time. Ag\nnever got an answer to her letter to Chicago about it. A short time\nafter he contracted gonorrhea from a sales girl from The Fair riding\nin a taxicab through Lincoln Park.\n\nchapter 11\n\nIn 1919 he was travelling on the railroads in Italy carrying a square\nof oilcloth from the headquarters of the party written in indelible\npencil and saying here was a comrade who had suffered very much under\nthe whites in Budapest and requesting comrades to aid him in any way.\nHe used this instead of a ticket. He was very shy and quite young and\nthe train men passed him on from one crew to another. He had no\nmoney, and they fed him behind the counter in railway eating houses.\n\nHe was delighted with Italy. It was a beautiful country he said. The\npeople were all kind. He had been in many towns, walked much and seen\nmany pictures. Giotto, Masaccio, and Piero della Francesca he bought\nreproductions of and carried them wrapped in a copy of _Avanti_.\nMantegna he did not like.\n\nHe reported at Bologna, and I took him with me up into the Romagna\nwhere it was necessary I go to see a man. We had a good trip\ntogether. It was early September and the country was pleasant. He was\na Magyar, a very nice boy and very shy. Horthy’s men had done some\nbad things to him. He talked about it a little. In spite of Italy, he\nbelieved altogether in the world revolution.\n\nAt Bologna he said good-bye to us to go on the train to Milano and\nthen to Aosta to walk over the pass into Switzerland. I spoke to him\nabout the Mantegnas in Milano. No, he said, very shyly, he did not\nlike Mantegna. I wrote out for him where to eat in Milano and the\naddresses of comrades. He thanked me very much, but his mind was\nalready looking forward to walking over the pass. He was very eager\nto walk over the pass while the weather held good. The last I heard\nof him the Swiss had him in jail near Sion.\n\nchapter 12"}

He cantered\njerkily along the barrera. He stopped stiff and one of the _monos_\nheld his bridle and walked him forward. The picador kicked in his\nspurs, leaned forward and shook his lance at the bull. Blood pumped\nregularly from between the horse’s front legs. He was nervously\nwobbly. The bull could not make up his mind to charge.\n\nchapter 13\n\nThe crowd shouted all the time and threw pieces of bread down into\nthe ring, then cushions and leather wine bottles, keeping up\nwhistling and yelling. Finally the bull was too tired from so much\nbad sticking and folded his knees and lay down and one of the\n_cuadrilla_ leaned out over his neck and killed him with the\n_puntillo_. The crowd came over the barrera and around the torero and\ntwo men grabbed him and held him and some one cut off his pigtail and\nwas waving it and a kid grabbed it and ran away with it.

I am\nnot really a good bull fighter.\n\nchapter 14\n\nIf it happened right down close in front of you, you could see\nVillalta snarl at the bull and curse him, and when the bull charged\nhe swung back firmly like an oak when the wind hits it, his legs\ntight together, the muleta trailing and the sword following the curve\nbehind. Then he cursed the bull, flopped the muleta at him, and swung\nback from the charge his feet firm, the muleta curving and each swing\nthe crowd roaring.\n\nWhen he started to kill it was all in the same rush. The bull looking\nat him straight in front, hating. He drew out the sword from the\nfolds of the muleta and sighted with the same movement and called to\nthe bull, Toro! Toro! and the bull charged and Villalta charged and\njust for a moment they became one. Villalta became one with the bull\nand then it was over. Villalta standing straight and the red kilt of\nthe sword sticking out dully between the bull’s shoulders. Villalta,\nhis hand up at the crowd and the bull roaring blood, looking straight\nat Villalta and his legs caving.\n\nchapter 15\n\nI heard the drums coming down the street and then the fifes and the\npipes and then they came around the corner, all dancing. The street\nfull of them. Maera saw him and then I saw him. When they stopped the\nmusic for the crouch he hunched down in the street with them all and\nwhen they started it again he jumped up and went dancing down the\nstreet with them. He was drunk all right.\n\nYou go down after him, said Maera, he hates me.\n\nSo I went down and caught up with them and grabbed him while he was\ncrouched down waiting for the music to break loose and said, Come on\nLuis. For Christ sake you’ve got bulls this afternoon. He didn’t\nlisten to me, he was listening so hard for the music to start.\n\nI said, Don’t be a damn fool Luis. Come on back to the hotel.\n\nThen the music started up again and he jumped up and twisted away\nfrom me and started dancing. I grabbed his arm and he pulled loose\nand said, Oh leave me alone. You’re not my father.\n\nI went back to the hotel and Maera was on the balcony looking out to\nsee if I’d be bringing him back. He went inside when he saw me and\ncame downstairs disgusted.\n\nWell, I said, after all he’s just an ignorant Mexican savage.\n\nYes, Maera said, and who will kill his bulls after he gets a\n_cogida?_\n\nWe, I suppose, I said.\n\nYes, we, said Maera.

{"text": "_and for_ JOHN HADLEY NICANOR\n\n”One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; but\n    the earth abideth forever. . . . The sun also ariseth, and the\n    sun goeth down, and hasteth to the place where he arose. . . .\n    The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the\n    north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth\n    again according to his circuits. . . .

Do not\nthink that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it\nmeant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked\nit, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling\nof inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at\nPrinceton. There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock\ndown anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a\nthoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym. He was Spider\nKelly’s star pupil. Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box\nlike featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five\nor two hundred and five pounds. But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really\nvery fast. He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got\nhis nose permanently flattened. This increased Cohn’s distaste for\nboxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and\nit certainly improved his nose. In his last year at Princeton he read\ntoo much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his\nclass who remembered him. They did not even remember that he was\nmiddleweight boxing champion.\n\nI mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories\nhold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had\nnever been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had\nstepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or\nseen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young\nchild, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly.\nSpider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had\nbecome of him.\n\nRobert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest\nJewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the\noldest. At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and\nplayed a very good end on the football team, no one had made him\nrace-conscious. No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence\nany different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton. He was a\nnice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter. He took\nit out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful\nself-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first\ngirl who was nice to him. He was married five years, had three children,\nlost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance\nof the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather\nunattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just\nwhen he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off\nwith a miniature-painter. As he had been thinking for months about\nleaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to\ndeprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock."}
{"text": "The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast. In\nCalifornia he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little\nof the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of\nthe Arts. The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and\nfinished in Provincetown, Massachusetts. By that time Cohn, who had been\nregarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the\neditorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the\nsole editor. It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority\nof editing. He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he\nhad to give it up.\n\nBy that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been\ntaken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine. She was\nvery forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand.\nAlso he was sure that he loved her. When this lady saw that the magazine\nwas not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and\ndecided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was\nstill something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where\nCohn could write. They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated,\nand stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in\ntravel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks\nand myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend.\n\nThe lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the\nsecond year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert\nchanged from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute\ndetermination that he should marry her. During this time Robert’s mother\nhad settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month.\nDuring two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at\nanother woman. He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living\nin Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered\nwriting. He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the\ncritics later called it, although it was a very poor novel. He read many\nbooks, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.\n\nI first became aware of his lady’s attitude toward him one night after\nthe three of us had dined together. We had dined at l’Avenue’s and\nafterward went to the Café de Versailles for coffee. We had several\n_fines_ after the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been\ntalking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip. He\nwanted to get out of town and get in a good walk. I suggested we fly to\nStrasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace.\n“I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town,” I said.\n\nSomebody kicked me under the table. I thought it was accidental and went\non: “She’s been there two years and knows everything there is to know\nabout the town. She’s a swell girl.”\n\nI was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert’s\nlady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.\n\n“Hell,” I said, “why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to\nthe Ardennes.”\n\nCohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said good-night and went\nout. Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner\nwith me. “For God’s sake,” he said, “why did you say that about that\ngirl in Strasbourg for? Didn’t you see Frances?”\n\n“No, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg\nwhat the hell is it to Frances?”\n\n“It doesn’t make any difference. Any girl. I couldn’t go, that would be\nall.”\n\n“Don’t be silly.”\n\n“You don’t know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn’t you see the way she\nlooked?”\n\n“Oh, well,” I said, “let’s go to Senlis.”\n\n“Don’t get sore.”\n\n“I’m not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerf\nand take a hike in the woods and come home.”\n\n“Good, that will be fine.”\n\n“Well, I’ll see you to-morrow at the courts,” I said.\n\n“Good-night, Jake,” he said, and started back to the café.\n\n“You forgot to get your paper,” I said."}
{"text": "“That’s so.” He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. “You are\nnot sore, are you, Jake?” He turned with the paper in his hand.\n\n“No, why should I be?”\n\n“See you at tennis,” he said. I watched him walk back to the café\nholding his paper. I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a\nlife.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   2\n\nThat winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was\naccepted by a fairly good publisher. His going made an awful row I\nheard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because several\nwomen were nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quite\nchanged. He was more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he was\nnot so simple, and he was not so nice. The publishers had praised his\nnovel pretty highly and it rather went to his head. Then several women\nhad put themselves out to be nice to him, and his horizons had all\nshifted. For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his\nwife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond\nFrances. I am sure he had never been in love in his life.\n\nHe had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college,\nand Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not\nbeen everything to his first wife. He was not in love yet but he\nrealized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact\nof a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply a\ndivine miracle. This changed him so that he was not so pleasant to have\naround. Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in some\nrather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had held\ncards and won several hundred dollars. It made him rather vain of his\nbridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always make\na living at bridge if he were ever forced to.\n\nThen there was another thing. He had been reading W. H. Hudson. That\nsounds like an innocent occupation, but Cohn had read and reread “The\nPurple Land.” “The Purple Land” is a very sinister book if read too late\nin life. It recounts splendid imaginary amorous adventures of a perfect\nEnglish gentleman in an intensely romantic land, the scenery of which is\nvery well described. For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-book\nto what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the same\nage to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent, equipped with a\ncomplete set of the more practical Alger books. Cohn, I believe, took\nevery word of “The Purple Land” as literally as though it had been an\nR. G. Dun report. You understand me, he made some reservations, but on\nthe whole the book to him was sound. It was all that was needed to set\nhim off. I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until\none day he came into my office.\n\n“Hello, Robert,” I said. “Did you come in to cheer me up?”\n\n“Would you like to go to South America, Jake?” he asked.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“I don’t know. I never wanted to go. Too expensive. You can see all the\nSouth Americans you want in Paris anyway.”\n\n“They’re not the real South Americans.”\n\n“They look awfully real to me.”\n\nI had a boat train to catch with a week’s mail stories, and only half of\nthem written.\n\n“Do you know any dirt?” I asked.\n\n“No.”\n\n“None of your exalted connections getting divorces?”\n\n“No; listen, Jake. If I handled both our expenses, would you go to South\nAmerica with me?”\n\n“Why me?”\n\n“You can talk Spanish. And it would be more fun with two of us.”\n\n“No,” I said, “I like this town and I go to Spain in the summer-time.”\n\n“All my life I’ve wanted to go on a trip like that,” Cohn said. He sat\ndown. “I’ll be too old before I can ever do it.”\n\n“Don’t be a fool,” I said. “You can go anywhere you want. You’ve got\nplenty of money.”\n\n“I know. But I can’t get started.”\n\n“Cheer up,” I said. “All countries look just like the moving pictures.”\n\nBut I felt sorry for him. He had it badly.\n\n“I can’t stand it to think my life is going so fast and I’m not really\nliving it.”\n\n“Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters.”"}
{"text": "“I’m not interested in bull-fighters. That’s an abnormal life. I want to\ngo back in the country in South America. We could have a great trip.”\n\n“Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?”\n\n“No, I wouldn’t like that.”\n\n“I’d go there with you.”\n\n“No; that doesn’t interest me.”\n\n“That’s because you never read a book about it. Go on and read a book\nall full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses.”\n\n“I want to go to South America.”\n\nHe had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak.\n\n“Come on down-stairs and have a drink.”\n\n“Aren’t you working?”\n\n“No,” I said. We went down the stairs to the café on the ground floor. I\nhad discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends. Once you had\na drink all you had to say was: “Well, I’ve got to get back and get off\nsome cables,” and it was done. It is very important to discover graceful\nexits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important\npart of the ethics that you should never seem to be working. Anyway, we\nwent down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda. Cohn looked at\nthe bottles in bins around the wall. “This is a good place,” he said.\n\n“There’s a lot of liquor,” I agreed.\n\n“Listen, Jake,” he leaned forward on the bar. “Don’t you ever get the\nfeeling that all your life is going by and you’re not taking advantage\nof it? Do you realize you’ve lived nearly half the time you have to live\nalready?”\n\n“Yes, every once in a while.”\n\n“Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we’ll be dead?”\n\n“What the hell, Robert,” I said. “What the hell.”\n\n“I’m serious.”\n\n“It’s one thing I don’t worry about,” I said.\n\n“You ought to.”\n\n“I’ve had plenty to worry about one time or other. I’m through\nworrying.”\n\n“Well, I want to go to South America.”\n\n“Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn’t make any difference.\nI’ve tried all that. You can’t get away from yourself by moving from one\nplace to another. There’s nothing to that.”\n\n“But you’ve never been to South America.”\n\n“South America hell! If you went there the way you feel now it would be\nexactly the same. This is a good town. Why don’t you start living your\nlife in Paris?”\n\n“I’m sick of Paris, and I’m sick of the Quarter.”\n\n“Stay away from the Quarter. Cruise around by yourself and see what\nhappens to you.”\n\n“Nothing happens to me. I walked alone all one night and nothing\nhappened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my papers.”\n\n“Wasn’t the town nice at night?”\n\n“I don’t care for Paris.”\n\nSo there you were. I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you could\ndo anything about, because right away you ran up against the two\nstubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris. He\ngot the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a\nbook too.\n\n“Well,” I said, “I’ve got to go up-stairs and get off some cables.”\n\n“Do you really have to go?”\n\n“Yes, I’ve got to get these cables off.”\n\n“Do you mind if I come up and sit around the office?”\n\n“No, come on up.”\n\nHe sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor and\nPublisher and I worked hard for two hours. Then I sorted out the\ncarbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila\nenvelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare. I went\nout into the other room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the big\nchair. He was asleep with his head on his arms. I did not like to wake\nhim up, but I wanted to lock the office and shove off. I put my hand on\nhis shoulder. He shook his head. “I can’t do it,” he said, and put his\nhead deeper into his arms. “I can’t do it. Nothing will make me do it.”\n\n“Robert,” I said, and shook him by the shoulder. He looked up. He smiled\nand blinked.\n\n“Did I talk out loud just then?”\n\n“Something. But it wasn’t clear.”\n\n“God, what a rotten dream!”\n\n“Did the typewriter put you to sleep?”\n\n“Guess so. I didn’t sleep all last night.”\n\n“What was the matter?”\n\n“Talking,” he said.\n\nI could picture it. I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom\nscenes of my friends. We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an\n_apéritif_ and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   3"}
{"text": "It was a warm spring night and I sat at a table on the terrace of the\nNapolitain after Robert had gone, watching it get dark and the electric\nsigns come on, and the red and green stop-and-go traffic-signal, and the\ncrowd going by, and the horse-cabs clippety-clopping along at the edge\nof the solid taxi traffic, and the _poules_ going by, singly and in\npairs, looking for the evening meal. I watched a good-looking girl walk\npast the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her,\nand watched another, and then saw the first one coming back again. She\nwent by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat down\nat the table. The waiter came up.\n\n“Well, what will you drink?” I asked.\n\n“Pernod.”\n\n“That’s not good for little girls.”\n\n“Little girl yourself. Dites garçon, un pernod.”\n\n“A pernod for me, too.”\n\n“What’s the matter?” she asked. “Going on a party?”\n\n“Sure. Aren’t you?”\n\n“I don’t know. You never know in this town.”\n\n“Don’t you like Paris?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Why don’t you go somewhere else?”\n\n“Isn’t anywhere else.”\n\n“You’re happy, all right.”\n\n“Happy, hell!”\n\nPernod is greenish imitation absinthe. When you add water it turns\nmilky. It tastes like licorice and it has a good uplift, but it drops\nyou just as far. We sat and drank it, and the girl looked sullen.\n\n“Well,” I said, “are you going to buy me a dinner?”\n\nShe grinned and I saw why she made a point of not laughing. With her\nmouth closed she was a rather pretty girl. I paid for the saucers and we\nwalked out to the street. I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up\nat the curb. Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling _fiacre_ we\nmoved up the Avenue de l’Opéra, passed the locked doors of the shops,\ntheir windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted.\nThe cab passed the New York _Herald_ bureau with the window full of\nclocks.\n\n“What are all the clocks for?” she asked.\n\n“They show the hour all over America.”\n\n“Don’t kid me.”\n\nWe turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides, through the traffic\nof the Rue de Rivoli, and through a dark gate into the Tuileries. She\ncuddled against me and I put my arm around her. She looked up to be\nkissed. She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.\n\n“Never mind.”\n\n“What’s the matter? You sick?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Everybody’s sick. I’m sick, too.”\n\nWe came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine and\nthen turned up the Rue des Saints Pères.\n\n“You oughtn’t to drink pernod if you’re sick.”\n\n“You neither.”\n\n“It doesn’t make any difference with me. It doesn’t make any difference\nwith a woman.”\n\n“What are you called?”\n\n“Georgette. How are you called?”\n\n“Jacob.”\n\n“That’s a Flemish name.”\n\n“American too.”\n\n“You’re not Flamand?”\n\n“No, American.”\n\n“Good, I detest Flamands.”\n\nBy this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the _cocher_ to\nstop. We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place.\n“This is no great thing of a restaurant.”\n\n“No,” I said. “Maybe you would rather go to Foyot’s. Why don’t you keep\nthe cab and go on?”\n\nI had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be\nnice to eat with some one. It was a long time since I had dined with a\n_poule_, and I had forgotten how dull it could be. We went into the\nrestaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room.\nGeorgette cheered up a little under the food.\n\n“It isn’t bad here,” she said. “It isn’t chic, but the food is all\nright.”\n\n“Better than you eat in Liège.”\n\n“Brussels, you mean.”\n\nWe had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke. She smiled and\nshowed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses. “You’re not a bad\ntype,” she said. “It’s a shame you’re sick. We get on well. What’s the\nmatter with you, anyway?”\n\n“I got hurt in the war,” I said.\n\n“Oh, that dirty war.”\n\nWe would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it\nwas in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been\nbetter avoided. I was bored enough. Just then from the other room some\none called: “Barnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!”\n\n“It’s a friend calling me,” I explained, and went out.\n\nThere was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne,\nMrs. Braddocks, several people I did not know.\n\n“You’re coming to the dance, aren’t you?” Braddocks asked."}
{"text": "“What dance?”\n\n“Why, the dancings. Don’t you know we’ve revived them?” Mrs. Braddocks\nput in.\n\n“You must come, Jake. We’re all going,” Frances said from the end of the\ntable. She was tall and had a smile.\n\n“Of course, he’s coming,” Braddocks said. “Come in and have coffee with\nus, Barnes.”\n\n“Right.”\n\n“And bring your friend,” said Mrs. Braddocks laughing. She was a\nCanadian and had all their easy social graces.\n\n“Thanks, we’ll be in,” I said. I went back to the small room.\n\n“Who are your friends?” Georgette asked.\n\n“Writers and artists.”\n\n“There are lots of those on this side of the river.”\n\n“Too many.”\n\n“I think so. Still, some of them make money.”\n\n“Oh, yes.”\n\nWe finished the meal and the wine. “Come on,” I said. “We’re going to\nhave coffee with the others.”\n\nGeorgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in\nthe little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lipstick, and\nstraightened her hat.\n\n“Good,” she said.\n\nWe went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at his\ntable stood up.\n\n“I wish to present my fiancée, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc,” I said.\nGeorgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round.\n\n“Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?” Mrs. Braddocks\nasked.\n\n“Connais pas,” Georgette answered.\n\n“But you have the same name,” Mrs. Braddocks insisted cordially.\n\n“No,” said Georgette. “Not at all. My name is Hobin.”\n\n“But Mr. Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc. Surely\nhe did,” insisted Mrs. Braddocks, who in the excitement of talking\nFrench was liable to have no idea what she was saying.\n\n“He’s a fool,” Georgette said.\n\n“Oh, it was a joke, then,” Mrs. Braddocks said.\n\n“Yes,” said Georgette. “To laugh at.”\n\n“Did you hear that, Henry?” Mrs. Braddocks called down the table to\nBraddocks. “Mr. Barnes introduced his fiancée as Mademoiselle Leblanc,\nand her name is actually Hobin.”\n\n“Of course, darling. Mademoiselle Hobin, I’ve known her for a very long\ntime.”\n\n“Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin,” Frances Clyne called, speaking French very\nrapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its\ncoming out really French. “Have you been in Paris long? Do you like it\nhere? You love Paris, do you not?”\n\n“Who’s she?” Georgette turned to me. “Do I have to talk to her?”\n\nShe turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her head\npoised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again.\n\n“No, I don’t like Paris. It’s expensive and dirty.”\n\n“Really? I find it so extraordinarily clean. One of the cleanest cities\nin all Europe.”\n\n“I find it dirty.”\n\n“How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long.”\n\n“I’ve been here long enough.”\n\n“But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that.”\n\nGeorgette turned to me. “You have nice friends.”\n\nFrances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but\nthe coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we all\nwent out and started for Braddocks’s dancing-club.\n\nThe dancing-club was a _bal musette_ in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte\nGeneviève. Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter\ndanced there. One night a week it was the dancing-club. On Monday nights\nit was closed. When we arrived it was quite empty, except for a\npoliceman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of the\nzinc bar, and the proprietor himself. The daughter of the house came\ndownstairs as we went in. There were long benches, and tables ran across\nthe room, and at the far end a dancing-floor.\n\n“I wish people would come earlier,” Braddocks said. The daughter came up\nand wanted to know what we would drink. The proprietor got up on a high\nstool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion. He had a\nstring of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as\nhe played. Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor\nperspiring.\n\n“My God,” Georgette said. “What a box to sweat in!”\n\n“It’s hot.”\n\n“Hot, my God!”\n\n“Take off your hat.”\n\n“That’s a good idea.”"}
{"text": "Some one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar. It was\nreally very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night. I\ndrank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of\nwind from the street. Two taxis were coming down the steep street. They\nboth stopped in front of the Bal. A crowd of young men, some in jerseys\nand some in their shirt-sleeves, got out. I could see their hands and\nnewly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door. The policeman\nstanding by the door looked at me and smiled. They came in. As they went\nin, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces,\ngrimacing, gesturing, talking. With them was Brett. She looked very\nlovely and she was very much with them.\n\nOne of them saw Georgette and said: “I do declare. There is an actual\nharlot. I’m going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me.”\n\nThe tall dark one, called Lett, said: “Don’t you be rash.”\n\nThe wavy blond one answered: “Don’t you worry, dear.” And with them was\nBrett.\n\nI was very angry. Somehow they always made me angry. I know they are\nsupposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to\nswing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering\ncomposure. Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar\nat the next Bal. The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to take\nthe taste out of my mouth. When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd\non the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who\ndanced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he\ndanced. As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to\ndance. She had been taken up by them. I knew then that they would all\ndance with her. They are like that.\n\nI sat down at a table. Cohn was sitting there. Frances was dancing. Mrs.\nBraddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss. He\nwas from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist. He\nhad some sort of an English accent. I asked him to have a drink.\n\n“Thanks so much,” he said, “I’ve just had one.”\n\n“Have another.”\n\n“Thanks, I will then.”\n\nWe got the daughter of the house over and each had a _fine à l’eau_.\n\n“You’re from Kansas City, they tell me,” he said.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Do you find Paris amusing?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Really?”\n\nI was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to\nbe careless.\n\n“For God’s sake,” I said, “yes. Don’t you?”\n\n“Oh, how charmingly you get angry,” he said. “I wish I had that\nfaculty.”\n\nI got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor. Mrs. Braddocks\nfollowed me. “Don’t be cross with Robert,” she said. “He’s still only a\nchild, you know.”\n\n“I wasn’t cross,” I said. “I just thought perhaps I was going to throw\nup.”\n\n“Your fiancée is having a great success,” Mrs. Braddocks looked out on\nthe floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one,\ncalled Lett.\n\n“Isn’t she?” I said.\n\n“Rather,” said Mrs. Braddocks.\n\nCohn came up. “Come on, Jake,” he said, “have a drink.” We walked over\nto the bar. “What’s the matter with you? You seem all worked up over\nsomething?”\n\n“Nothing. This whole show makes me sick is all.”\n\nBrett came up to the bar.\n\n“Hello, you chaps.”\n\n“Hello, Brett,” I said. “Why aren’t you tight?”\n\n“Never going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and\nsoda.”\n\nShe stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her. He\nlooked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the\npromised land. Cohn, of course, was much younger. But he had that look\nof eager, deserving expectation.\n\nBrett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a\ntweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy’s. She started all\nthat. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you\nmissed none of it with that wool jersey.\n\n“It’s a fine crowd you’re with, Brett,” I said.\n\n“Aren’t they lovely? And you, my dear. Where did you get it?”\n\n“At the Napolitain.”\n\n“And have you had a lovely evening?”\n\n“Oh, priceless,” I said.\n\nBrett laughed. “It’s wrong of you, Jake. It’s an insult to all of us.\nLook at Frances there, and Jo.”\n\nThis for Cohn’s benefit.\n\n“It’s in restraint of trade,” Brett said. She laughed again."}
{"text": "“You’re wonderfully sober,” I said.\n\n“Yes. Aren’t I? And when one’s with the crowd I’m with, one can drink in\nsuch safety, too.”\n\nThe music started and Robert Cohn said: “Will you dance this with me,\nLady Brett?”\n\nBrett smiled at him. “I’ve promised to dance this with Jacob,” she\nlaughed. “You’ve a hell of a biblical name, Jake.”\n\n“How about the next?” asked Cohn.\n\n“We’re going,” Brett said. “We’ve a date up at Montmartre.” Dancing, I\nlooked over Brett’s shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still\nwatching her.\n\n“You’ve made a new one there,” I said to her.\n\n“Don’t talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now.”\n\n“Oh, well,” I said. “I suppose you like to add them up.”\n\n“Don’t talk like a fool.”\n\n“You do.”\n\n“Oh, well. What if I do?”\n\n“Nothing,” I said. We were dancing to the accordion and some one was\nplaying the banjo. It was hot and I felt happy. We passed close to\nGeorgette dancing with another one of them.\n\n“What possessed you to bring her?”\n\n“I don’t know, I just brought her.”\n\n“You’re getting damned romantic.”\n\n“No, bored.”\n\n“Now?”\n\n“No, not now.”\n\n“Let’s get out of here. She’s well taken care of.”\n\n“Do you want to?”\n\n“Would I ask you if I didn’t want to?”\n\nWe left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it\non. Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her. I stopped at the\nbar and asked them for an envelope. The patronne found one. I took a\nfifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and\nhanded it to the patronne.\n\n“If the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?” I said.\n“If she goes out with one of those gentlemen, will you save this for\nme?”\n\n“C’est entendu, Monsieur,” the patronne said. “You go now? So early?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\nWe started out the door. Cohn was still talking to Brett. She said good\nnight and took my arm. “Good night, Cohn,” I said. Outside in the street\nwe looked for a taxi.\n\n“You’re going to lose your fifty francs,” Brett said.\n\n“Oh, yes.”\n\n“No taxis.”\n\n“We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one.”\n\n“Come on and we’ll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one.”\n\n“You wouldn’t walk across the street.”\n\n“Not if I could help it.”\n\nWe went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi.\n\n“Well,” I said, “we’re out away from them.”\n\nWe stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each\nother. The waiter came and said the taxi was outside. Brett pressed my\nhand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out. “Where should I\ntell him?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, tell him to drive around.”\n\nI told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammed\nthe door. Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed. I got\nin and sat beside her. The cab started with a jerk.\n\n“Oh, darling, I’ve been so miserable,” Brett said.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   4\n\nThe taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into the\ndark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St.\nEtienne du Mont, went smoothly down the asphalt, passed the trees and\nthe standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe, then turned onto the\ncobbles of the Rue Mouffetard. There were lighted bars and late open\nshops on each side of the street. We were sitting apart and we jolted\nclose together going down the old street. Brett’s hat was off. Her head\nwas back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was\ndark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des\nGobelins. The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracks\nby the light of acetylene flares. Brett’s face was white and the long\nline of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street\nwas dark again and I kissed her. Our lips were tight together and then\nshe turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away\nas she could get. Her head was down.\n\n“Don’t touch me,” she said. “Please don’t touch me.”\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“I can’t stand it.”\n\n“Oh, Brett.”\n\n“You mustn’t. You must know. I can’t stand it, that’s all. Oh, darling,\nplease understand!”\n\n“Don’t you love me?”\n\n“Love you? I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me.”\n\n“Isn’t there anything we can do about it?”"}
{"text": "She was sitting up now. My arm was around her and she was leaning back\nagainst me, and we were quite calm. She was looking into my eyes with\nthat way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw\nout of her own eyes. They would look on and on after every one else’s\neyes in the world would have stopped looking. She looked as though there\nwere nothing on earth she would not look at like that, and really she\nwas afraid of so many things.\n\n“And there’s not a damn thing we could do,” I said.\n\n“I don’t know,” she said. “I don’t want to go through that hell again.”\n\n“We’d better keep away from each other.”\n\n“But, darling, I have to see you. It isn’t all that you know.”\n\n“No, but it always gets to be.”\n\n“That’s my fault. Don’t we pay for all the things we do, though?”\n\nShe had been looking into my eyes all the time. Her eyes had different\ndepths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat. Now you could see all the\nway into them.\n\n“When I think of the hell I’ve put chaps through. I’m paying for it all\nnow.”\n\n“Don’t talk like a fool,” I said. “Besides, what happened to me is\nsupposed to be funny. I never think about it.”\n\n“Oh, no. I’ll lay you don’t.”\n\n“Well, let’s shut up about it.”\n\n“I laughed about it too, myself, once.” She wasn’t looking at me. “A\nfriend of my brother’s came home that way from Mons. It seemed like a\nhell of a joke. Chaps never know anything, do they?”\n\n“No,” I said. “Nobody ever knows anything.”\n\nI was pretty well through with the subject. At one time or another I had\nprobably considered it from most of its various angles, including the\none that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment\nwhile remaining quite serious for the person possessing them.\n\n“It’s funny,” I said. “It’s very funny. And it’s a lot of fun, too, to\nbe in love.”\n\n“Do you think so?” her eyes looked flat again.\n\n“I don’t mean fun that way. In a way it’s an enjoyable feeling.”\n\n“No,” she said. “I think it’s hell on earth.”\n\n“It’s good to see each other.”\n\n“No. I don’t think it is.”\n\n“Don’t you want to?”\n\n“I have to.”\n\nWe were sitting now like two strangers. On the right was the Parc\nMontsouris. The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and\nwhere you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark. The\ndriver leaned his head around.\n\n“Where do you want to go?” I asked. Brett turned her head away.\n\n“Oh, go to the Select.”\n\n“Café Select,” I told the driver. “Boulevard Montparnasse.” We drove\nstraight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards the\npassing Montrouge trams. Brett looked straight ahead. On the Boulevard\nRaspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: “Would\nyou mind very much if I asked you to do something?”\n\n“Don’t be silly.”\n\n“Kiss me just once more before we get there.”\n\nWhen the taxi stopped I got out and paid. Brett came out putting on her\nhat. She gave me her hand as she stepped down. Her hand was shaky. “I\nsay, do I look too much of a mess?” She pulled her man’s felt hat down\nand started in for the bar. Inside, against the bar and at tables, were\nmost of the crowd who a been at the dance.\n\n“Hello, you chaps,” Brett said. “I’m going to have a drink.”\n\n“Oh, Brett! Brett!” the little Greek portrait-painter, who called\nhimself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her. “I got\nsomething fine to tell you.”\n\n“Hello, Zizi,” Brett said.\n\n“I want you to meet a friend,” Zizi said. A fat man came up.\n\n“Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley.”\n\n“How do you do?” said Brett.\n\n“Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?” asked Count\nMippipopolous, who wore an elk’s tooth on his watch-chain.\n\n“Rather,” said Brett.\n\n“Paris is a fine town all right,” said the count. “But I guess you have\npretty big doings yourself over in London.”\n\n“Oh, yes,” said Brett. “Enormous.”\n\nBraddocks called to me from a table. “Barnes,” he said, “have a drink.\nThat girl of yours got in a frightful row.”\n\n“What about?”\n\n“Something the patronne’s daughter said. A corking row. She was rather\nsplendid, you know. Showed her yellow card and demanded the patronne’s\ndaughter’s too. I say it was a row.”\n\n“What finally happened?”"}
{"text": "“Oh, some one took her home. Not a bad-looking girl. Wonderful command\nof the idiom. Do stay and have a drink.”\n\n“No,” I said. “I must shove off. Seen Cohn?”\n\n“He went home with Frances,” Mrs. Braddock put in.\n\n“Poor chap, he looks awfully down,” Braddocks said.\n\n“I dare say he is,” said Mrs. Braddocks.\n\n“I have to shove off,” I said. “Good night.”\n\nI said good night to Brett at the bar. The count was buying champagne.\n“Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?” he asked.\n\n“No. Thanks awfully. I have to go.”\n\n“Really going?” Brett asked.\n\n“Yes,” I said. “I’ve got a rotten headache.”\n\n“I’ll see you to-morrow?”\n\n“Come in at the office.”\n\n“Hardly.”\n\n“Well, where will I see you?”\n\n“Anywhere around five o’clock.”\n\n“Make it the other side of town then.”\n\n“Good. I’ll be at the Crillon at five.”\n\n“Try and be there,” I said.\n\n“Don’t worry,” Brett said. “I’ve never let you down, have I?”\n\n“Heard from Mike?”\n\n“Letter to-day.”\n\n“Good night, sir,” said the count.\n\nI went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St.\nMichel, passed the tables of the Rotonde, still crowded, looked across\nthe street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of the\npavement. Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it was\nand went on. I wanted to get home. The Boulevard Montparnasse was\ndeserted. Lavigne’s was closed tight, and they were stacking the tables\noutside the Closerie des Lilas. I passed Ney’s statue standing among the\nnew-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light. There was a faded purple\nwreath leaning against the base. I stopped and read the inscription:\nfrom the Bonapartist Groups, some date; I forget. He looked very fine,\nMarshal Ney in his top-boots, gesturing with his sword among the green\nnew horse-chestnut leaves. My flat was just across the street, a little\nway down the Boulevard St. Michel.\n\nThere was a light in the concierge’s room and I knocked on the door and\nshe gave me my mail. I wished her good night and went up-stairs. There\nwere two letters and some papers. I looked at them under the gas-light\nin the dining-room. The letters were from the States. One was a bank\nstatement. It showed a balance of $2432.60. I got out my check-book and\ndeducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discovered\nI had a balance of $1832.60. I wrote this on the back of the statement.\nThe other letter was a wedding announcement. Mr. and Mrs. Aloysius Kirby\nannounce the marriage of their daughter Katherine—I knew neither the\ngirl nor the man she was marrying. They must be circularizing the town.\nIt was a funny name. I felt sure I could remember anybody with a name\nlike Aloysius. It was a good Catholic name. There was a crest on the\nannouncement. Like Zizi the Greek duke. And that count. The count was\nfunny. Brett had a title, too. Lady Ashley. To hell with Brett. To hell\nwith you, Lady Ashley.\n\nI lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the wide\nwindows. The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with the\nwindows open and undressed by the bed. Outside a night train, running on\nthe street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets. They\nwere noisy at night when you could not sleep. Undressing, I looked at\nmyself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed. That was a\ntypically French way to furnish a room. Practical, too, I suppose. Of\nall the ways to be wounded. I suppose it was funny. I put on my pajamas\nand got into bed. I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their\nwrappers off. One was orange. The other yellow. They would both have the\nsame news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other. _Le Toril_\nwas the better paper, so I started to read it. I read it all the way\nthrough, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams. I blew\nout the lamp. Perhaps I would be able to sleep."}
{"text": "My head started to work. The old grievance. Well, it was a rotten way to\nbe wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian. In the Italian\nhospital we were going to form a society. It had a funny name in\nItalian. I wonder what became of the others, the Italians. That was in\nthe Ospedale Maggiore in Milano, Padiglione Ponte. The next building was\nthe Padiglione Zonda. There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it was\nZonda. That was where the liaison colonel came to visit me. That was\nfunny. That was about the first funny thing. I was all bandaged up. But\nthey had told him about it. Then he made that wonderful speech: “You, a\nforeigner, an Englishman” (any foreigner was an Englishman) “have given\nmore than your life.” What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated\nto hang in the office. He never laughed. He was putting himself in my\nplace, I guess. “Che mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna!”\n\nI never used to realize it, I guess. I try and play it along and just\nnot make trouble for people. Probably I never would have had any trouble\nif I hadn’t run into Brett when they shipped me to England. I suppose\nshe only wanted what she couldn’t have. Well, people were that way. To\nhell with people. The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of\nhandling all that. Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it\nwas swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.\n\nI lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn’t keep\naway from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it\nwent away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around\nand started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I\nstarted to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and\nlistened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I\nwent to sleep.\n\nI woke up. There was a row going on outside. I listened and I thought I\nrecognized a voice. I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door. The\nconcierge was talking down-stairs. She was very angry. I heard my name\nand called down the stairs.\n\n“Is that you, Monsieur Barnes?” the concierge called.\n\n“Yes. It’s me.”\n\n“There’s a species of woman here who’s waked the whole street up. What\nkind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see\nyou. I’ve told her you’re asleep.”\n\nThen I heard Brett’s voice. Half asleep I had been sure it was\nGeorgette. I don’t know why. She could not have known my address.\n\n“Will you send her up, please?”\n\nBrett came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk. “Silly thing to\ndo,” she said. “Make an awful row. I say, you weren’t asleep, were you?”\n\n“What did you think I was doing?”\n\n“Don’t know. What time is it?”\n\nI looked at the clock. It was half-past four. “Had no idea what hour it\nwas,” Brett said. “I say, can a chap sit down? Don’t be cross, darling.\nJust left the count. He brought me here.”\n\n“What’s he like?” I was getting brandy and soda and glasses.\n\n“Just a little,” said Brett. “Don’t try and make me drunk. The count?\nOh, rather. He’s quite one of us.”\n\n“Is he a count?”\n\n“Here’s how. I rather think so, you know. Deserves to be, anyhow. Knows\nhell’s own amount about people. Don’t know where he got it all. Owns a\nchain of sweetshops in the States.”\n\nShe sipped at her glass.\n\n“Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up.\nTold me a little about it. Damned interesting. He’s one of us, though.\nOh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell.”\n\nShe took another drink.\n\n“How do I buck on about all this? You don’t mind, do you? He’s putting\nup for Zizi, you know.”\n\n“Is Zizi really a duke, too?”\n\n“I shouldn’t wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the\ncount.”\n\n“Where did you go with him?”\n\n“Oh, everywhere. He just brought me here now. Offered me ten thousand\ndollars to go to Biarritz with him. How much is that in pounds?”\n\n“Around two thousand.”\n\n“Lot of money. I told him I couldn’t do it. He was awfully nice about\nit. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz.”\n\nBrett laughed.\n\n“I say, you are slow on the up-take,” she said. I had only sipped my\nbrandy and soda. I took a long drink."}
{"text": "“That’s better. Very funny,” Brett said. “Then he wanted me to go to\nCannes with him. Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo.\nTold him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many\npeople everywhere. Quite true, too. So I asked him to bring me here.”\n\nShe looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised. “Don’t look\nlike that,” she said. “Told him I was in love with you. True, too. Don’t\nlook like that. He was damn nice about it. Wants to drive us out to\ndinner to-morrow night. Like to go?”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“I’d better go now.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Just wanted to see you. Damned silly idea. Want to get dressed and come\ndown? He’s got the car just up the street.”\n\n“The count?”\n\n“Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have\nbreakfast in the Bois. Hampers. Got it all at Zelli’s. Dozen bottles of\nMumms. Tempt you?”\n\n“I have to work in the morning,” I said. “I’m too far behind you now to\ncatch up and be any fun.”\n\n“Don’t be an ass.”\n\n“Can’t do it.”\n\n“Right. Send him a tender message?”\n\n“Anything. Absolutely.”\n\n“Good night, darling.”\n\n“Don’t be sentimental.”\n\n“You make me ill.”\n\nWe kissed good night and Brett shivered. “I’d better go,” she said.\n“Good night, darling.”\n\n“You don’t have to go.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWe kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the\nconcierge muttered something behind her door. I went back up-stairs and\nfrom the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the big\nlimousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light. She got in and it\nstarted off. I turned around. On the table was an empty glass and a\nglass half-full of brandy and soda. I took them both out to the kitchen\nand poured the half-full glass down the sink. I turned off the gas in\nthe dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got into\nbed. This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about. Then I thought\nof her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last\nseen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is\nawfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at\nnight it is another thing.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   5\n\nIn the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for\ncoffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut trees in\nthe Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the pleasant\nearly-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers with the coffee\nand then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were coming up from the\nmarket and arranging their daily stock. Students went by going up to the\nlaw school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams\nand people going to work. I got on an S bus and rode down to the\nMadeleine, standing on the back platform. From the Madeleine I walked\nalong the Boulevard des Capucines to the Opéra, and up to my office. I\npassed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys. I\nstepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl\nassistant manipulated the boxers. She was standing looking away, the\nthread in her folded hands. The man was urging two tourists to buy.\nThree more tourists had stopped and were watching. I walked on behind a\nman who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO on the\nsidewalk in damp letters. All along people were going to work. It felt\npleasant to be going to work. I walked across the avenue and turned in\nto my office.\n\nUp-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and\nthen sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning’s work. At eleven\no’clock I went over to the Quai d’Orsay in a taxi and went in and sat\nwith about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece,\na young Nouvelle Revue Française diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles,\ntalked and answered questions for half an hour. The President of the\nCouncil was in Lyons making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back.\nSeveral people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a\ncouple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the\nanswers. There was no news. I shared a taxi back from the Quai d’Orsay\nwith Woolsey and Krum."}
{"text": "“What do you do nights, Jake?” asked Krum. “I never see you around.”\n\n“Oh, I’m over in the Quarter.”\n\n“I’m coming over some night. The Dingo. That’s the great place, isn’t\nit?”\n\n“Yes. That, or this new dive, The Select.”\n\n“I’ve meant to get over,” said Krum. “You know how it is, though, with a\nwife and kids.”\n\n“Playing any tennis?” Woolsey asked.\n\n“Well, no,” said Krum. “I can’t say I’ve played any this year. I’ve\ntried to get away, but Sundays it’s always rained, and the courts are so\ndamned crowded.”\n\n“The Englishmen all have Saturday off,” Woolsey said.\n\n“Lucky beggars,” said Krum. “Well, I’ll tell you. Some day I’m not going\nto be working for an agency. Then I’ll have plenty of time to get out in\nthe country.”\n\n“That’s the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car.”\n\n“I’ve been thinking some about getting a car next year.”\n\nI banged on the glass. The chauffeur stopped. “Here’s my street,” I\nsaid. “Come in and have a drink.”\n\n“Thanks, old man,” Krum said. Woolsey shook his head. “I’ve got to file\nthat line he got off this morning.”\n\nI put a two-franc piece in Krum’s hand.\n\n“You’re crazy, Jake,” he said. “This is on me.”\n\n“It’s all on the office, anyway.”\n\n“Nope. I want to get it.”\n\nI waved good-by. Krum put his head out. “See you at the lunch on\nWednesday.”\n\n“You bet.”\n\nI went to the office in the elevator. Robert Cohn was waiting for me.\n“Hello, Jake,” he said. “Going out to lunch?”\n\n“Yes. Let me see if there is anything new.”\n\n“Where will we eat?”\n\n“Anywhere.”\n\nI was looking over my desk. “Where do you want to eat?”\n\n“How about Wetzel’s? They’ve got good hors d’œuvres.”\n\nIn the restaurant we ordered hors d’œuvres and beer. The sommelier\nbrought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the steins, and cold.\nThere were a dozen different dishes of hors d’œuvres.\n\n“Have any fun last night?” I asked.\n\n“No. I don’t think so.”\n\n“How’s the writing going?”\n\n“Rotten. I can’t get this second book going.”\n\n“That happens to everybody.”\n\n“Oh, I’m sure of that. It gets me worried, though.”\n\n“Thought any more about going to South America?”\n\n“I mean that.”\n\n“Well, why don’t you start off?”\n\n“Frances.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “take her with you.”\n\n“She wouldn’t like it. That isn’t the sort of thing she likes. She likes\na lot of people around.”\n\n“Tell her to go to hell.”\n\n“I can’t. I’ve got certain obligations to her.”\n\nHe shoved the sliced cucumbers away and took a pickled herring.\n\n“What do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?”\n\n“Her name’s Lady Ashley. Brett’s her own name. She’s a nice girl,” I\nsaid. “She’s getting a divorce and she’s going to marry Mike Campbell.\nHe’s over in Scotland now. Why?”\n\n“She’s a remarkably attractive woman.”\n\n“Isn’t she?”\n\n“There’s a certain quality about her, a certain fineness. She seems to\nbe absolutely fine and straight.”\n\n“She’s very nice.”\n\n“I don’t know how to describe the quality,” Cohn said. “I suppose it’s\nbreeding.”\n\n“You sound as though you liked her pretty well.”\n\n“I do. I shouldn’t wonder if I were in love with her.”\n\n“She’s a drunk,” I said. “She’s in love with Mike Campbell, and she’s\ngoing to marry him. He’s going to be rich as hell some day.”\n\n“I don’t believe she’ll ever marry him.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“I don’t know. I just don’t believe it. Have you known her a long time?”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “She was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the\nwar.”\n\n“She must have been just a kid then.”\n\n“She’s thirty-four now.”\n\n“When did she marry Ashley?”\n\n“During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the\ndysentery.”\n\n“You talk sort of bitter.”\n\n“Sorry. I didn’t mean to. I was just trying to give you the facts.”\n\n“I don’t believe she would marry anybody she didn’t love.”\n\n“Well,” I said. “She’s done it twice.”\n\n“I don’t believe it.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “don’t ask me a lot of fool questions if you don’t like\nthe answers.”\n\n“I didn’t ask you that.”\n\n“You asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley.”\n\n“I didn’t ask you to insult her.”\n\n“Oh, go to hell.”\n\nHe stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white and\nangry behind the little plates of hors d’œuvres.\n\n“Sit down,” I said. “Don’t be a fool.”\n\n“You’ve got to take that back.”\n\n“Oh, cut out the prep-school stuff.”\n\n“Take it back.”\n\n“Sure. Anything. I never heard of Brett Ashley. How’s that?\n\n“No. Not that. About me going to hell.”"}
{"text": "“Oh, don’t go to hell,” I said. “Stick around. We’re just starting\nlunch.”\n\nCohn smiled again and sat down. He seemed glad to sit down. What the\nhell would he have done if he hadn’t sat down? “You say such damned\ninsulting things, Jake.”\n\n“I’m sorry. I’ve got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty\nthings.”\n\n“I know it,” Cohn said. “You’re really about the best friend I have,\nJake.”\n\nGod help you, I thought. “Forget what I said,” I said out loud. “I’m\nsorry.”\n\n“It’s all right. It’s fine. I was just sore for a minute.”\n\n“Good. Let’s get something else to eat.”\n\nAfter we finished the lunch we walked up to the Café de la Paix and had\ncoffee. I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held him\noff it. We talked about one thing and another, and I left him to come to\nthe office.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   6\n\nAt five o’clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was\nnot there, so I sat down and wrote some letters. They were not very good\nletters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them.\nBrett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar\nand had a Jack Rose with George the barman. Brett had not been in the\nbar either, and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a\ntaxi to the Café Select. Crossing the Seine I saw a string of barges\nbeing towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the\nsweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was\nalways pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.\n\nThe taxi rounded the statue of the inventor of the semaphore engaged in\ndoing same, and turned up the Boulevard Raspail, and I sat back to let\nthat part of the ride pass. The Boulevard Raspail always made dull\nriding. It was like a certain stretch on the P. L. M. between\nFontainebleau and Montereau that always made me feel bored and dead and\ndull until it was over. I suppose it is some association of ideas that\nmakes those dead places in a journey. There are other streets in Paris\nas ugly as the Boulevard Raspail. It is a street I do not mind walking\ndown at all. But I cannot stand to ride along it. Perhaps I had read\nsomething about it once. That was the way Robert Cohn was about all of\nParis. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris.\nPossibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe. So many young men\nget their likes and dislikes from Mencken.\n\nThe taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde. No matter what café in\nMontparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank\nof the river, they always take you to the Rotonde. Ten years from now it\nwill probably be the Dome. It was near enough, anyway. I walked past the\nsad tables of the Rotonde to the Select. There were a few people inside\nat the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone. He had a pile of\nsaucers in front of him, and he needed a shave.\n\n“Sit down,” said Harvey, “I’ve been looking for you.”\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“Nothing. Just looking for you.”\n\n“Been out to the races?”\n\n“No. Not since Sunday.”\n\n“What do you hear from the States?”\n\n“Nothing. Absolutely nothing.”\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“I don’t know. I’m through with them. I’m absolutely through with them.”\n\nHe leaned forward and looked me in the eye.\n\n“Do you want to know something, Jake?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I haven’t had anything to eat for five days.”\n\nI figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had\nwon two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“No money. Money hasn’t come,” he paused. “I tell you it’s strange,\nJake. When I’m like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my\nown room. I’m like a cat.”\n\nI felt in my pocket.\n\n“Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Come on. Let’s go and eat.”\n\n“There’s no hurry. Have a drink.”\n\n“Better eat.”\n\n“No. When I get like this I don’t care whether I eat or not.”\n\nWe had a drink. Harvey added my saucer to his own pile.\n\n“Do you know Mencken, Harvey?”\n\n“Yes. Why?”\n\n“What’s he like?”\n\n“He’s all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had\ndinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. ‘The trouble is,’ he said,\n‘he’s a garter snapper.’ That’s not bad.”\n\n“That’s not bad.”"}
{"text": "“He’s through now,” Harvey went on. “He’s written about all the things\nhe knows, and now he’s on all the things he doesn’t know.”\n\n“I guess he’s all right,” I said. “I just can’t read him.”\n\n“Oh, nobody reads him now,” Harvey said, “except the people that used to\nread the Alexander Hamilton Institute.”\n\n“Well,” I said. “That was a good thing, too.”\n\n“Sure,” said Harvey. So we sat and thought deeply for a while.\n\n“Have another port?”\n\n“All right,” said Harvey.\n\n“There comes Cohn,” I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street.\n\n“That moron,” said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table.\n\n“Hello, you bums,” he said.\n\n“Hello, Robert,” Harvey said. “I was just telling Jake here that you’re\na moron.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Tell us right off. Don’t think. What would you rather do if you could\ndo anything you wanted?”\n\nCohn started to consider.\n\n“Don’t think. Bring it right out.”\n\n“I don’t know,” Cohn said. “What’s it all about, anyway?”\n\n“I mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No\nmatter how silly it is.”\n\n“I don’t know,” Cohn said. “I think I’d rather play football again with\nwhat I know about handling myself, now.”\n\n“I misjudged you,” Harvey said. “You’re not a moron. You’re only a case\nof arrested development.”\n\n“You’re awfully funny, Harvey,” Cohn said. “Some day somebody will push\nyour face in.”\n\nHarvey Stone laughed. “You think so. They won’t, though. Because it\nwouldn’t make any difference to me. I’m not a fighter.”\n\n“It would make a difference to you if anybody did it.”\n\n“No, it wouldn’t. That’s where you make your big mistake. Because you’re\nnot intelligent.”\n\n“Cut it out about me.”\n\n“Sure,” said Harvey. “It doesn’t make any difference to me. You don’t\nmean anything to me.”\n\n“Come on, Harvey,” I said. “Have another porto.”\n\n“No,” he said. “I’m going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake.”\n\nHe walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street\nthrough the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic.\n\n“He always gets me sore,” Cohn said. “I can’t stand him.”\n\n“I like him,” I said. “I’m fond of him. You don’t want to get sore at\nhim.”\n\n“I know it,” Cohn said. “He just gets on my nerves.”\n\n“Write this afternoon?”\n\n“No. I couldn’t get it going. It’s harder to do than my first book. I’m\nhaving a hard time handling it.”\n\nThe sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America\nearly in the spring was gone. Then he had been sure of his work, only\nwith these personal longings for adventure. Now the sureness was gone.\nSomehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly. The reason is that\nuntil he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that\nwould, in any way, detach him from other people. He was nice to watch on\nthe tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he\nhandled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of\nundergraduate quality about him. If he were in a crowd nothing he said\nstood out. He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may\nbe called that still, but he was not professionally youthful. I do not\nbelieve he thought about his clothes much. Externally he had been formed\nat Princeton. Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had\ntrained him. He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never\nbeen trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out. He\nloved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for\ninstance. On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he\nfell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces. People beat\nhim who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it.\n\nAnyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the Café Select, and Harvey\nStone had just crossed the street.\n\n“Come on up to the Lilas,” I said.\n\n“I have a date.”\n\n“What time?”\n\n“Frances is coming here at seven-fifteen.”\n\n“There she is.”\n\nFrances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street. She was a\nvery tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and\nsmiled. We watched her cross the street.\n\n“Hello,” she said, “I’m so glad you’re here, Jake. I’ve been wanting to\ntalk to you.”\n\n“Hello, Frances,” said Cohn. He smiled."}
{"text": "“Why, hello, Robert. Are you here?” She went on, talking rapidly. “I’ve\nhad the darndest time. This one”—shaking her head at Cohn—“didn’t come\nhome for lunch.”\n\n“I wasn’t supposed to.”\n\n“Oh, I know. But you didn’t say anything about it to the cook. Then I\nhad a date myself, and Paula wasn’t at her office. I went to the Ritz\nand waited for her, and she never came, and of course I didn’t have\nenough money to lunch at the Ritz——”\n\n“What did you do?”\n\n“Oh, went out, of course.” She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful\nmanner. “I always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I\nought to know better. How are you, Jake, anyway?”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that\nBrett one.”\n\n“Don’t you like her?” Cohn asked.\n\n“I think she’s perfectly charming. Don’t you?”\n\nCohn said nothing.\n\n“Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the\nDome? You’ll stay here, won’t you, Robert? Come on, Jake.”\n\nWe crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table. A boy\ncame up with the _Paris Times_, and I bought one and opened it.\n\n“What’s the matter, Frances?”\n\n“Oh, nothing,” she said, “except that he wants to leave me.”\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\n“Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my\nmother and every one, and now he doesn’t want to do it.”\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“He’s decided he hasn’t lived enough. I knew it would happen when he\nwent to New York.”\n\nShe looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially.\n\n“I wouldn’t marry him if he doesn’t want to. Of course I wouldn’t. I\nwouldn’t marry him now for anything. But it does seem to me to be a\nlittle late now, after we’ve waited three years, and I’ve just gotten my\ndivorce.”\n\nI said nothing.\n\n“We were going to celebrate so, and instead we’ve just had scenes. It’s\nso childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be\nreasonable, but he says he just can’t do it.”\n\n“It’s rotten luck.”\n\n“I should say it is rotten luck. I’ve wasted two years and a half on him\nnow. And I don’t know now if any man will ever want to marry me. Two\nyears ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes. All the\nold ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy\nabout me. Now I don’t think I could get anybody.”\n\n“Sure, you could marry anybody.”\n\n“No, I don’t believe it. And I’m fond of him, too. And I’d like to have\nchildren. I always thought we’d have children.”\n\nShe looked at me very brightly. “I never liked children much, but I\ndon’t want to think I’ll never have them. I always thought I’d have them\nand then like them.”\n\n“He’s got children.”\n\n“Oh, yes. He’s got children, and he’s got money, and he’s got a rich\nmother, and he’s written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff;\nnobody at all. It isn’t bad, either. And I haven’t got any money at all.\nI could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way.”\n\nShe looked at me again very brightly.\n\n“It isn’t right. It’s my own fault and it’s not, too. I ought to have\nknown better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can’t marry.\nWhy can’t he marry? I’d be a good wife. I’m easy to get along with. I\nleave him alone. It doesn’t do any good.”\n\n“It’s a rotten shame.”\n\n“Yes, it is a rotten shame. But there’s no use talking about it, is\nthere? Come on, let’s go back to the café.”\n\n“And of course there isn’t anything I can do.”\n\n“No. Just don’t let him know I talked to you. I know what he wants.” Now\nfor the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. “He\nwants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out\nso when a lot of little chickens like it. That’s what he wants.”\n\n“Maybe they won’t like it. I don’t think he’s that way. Really.”\n\n“You don’t know him like I do, Jake. That’s what he wants to do. I know\nit. I know it. That’s why he doesn’t want to marry. He wants to have a\nbig triumph this fall all by himself.”\n\n“Want to go back to the café?”\n\n“Yes. Come on.”\n\nWe got up from the table—they had never brought us a drink—and started\nacross the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from\nbehind the marble-topped table.\n\n“Well, what are you smiling at?” Frances asked him. “Feel pretty happy?”"}
{"text": "“I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets.”\n\n“Oh, what I’ve told Jake isn’t any secret. Everybody will know it soon\nenough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version.”\n\n“What was it? About your going to England?”\n\n“Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I’m\ngoing to England.”\n\n“Isn’t that fine!”\n\n“Yes, that’s the way it’s done in the very best families. Robert’s\nsending me. He’s going to give me two hundred pounds and then I’m going\nto visit friends. Won’t it be lovely? The friends don’t know about it,\nyet.”\n\nShe turned to Cohn and smiled at him. He was not smiling now.\n\n“You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren’t you, Robert?\nBut I made him give me two hundred. He’s really very generous. Aren’t\nyou, Robert?”\n\nI do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn.\nThere are people to whom you could not say insulting things. They give\nyou a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be\ndestroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things. But here was\nCohn taking it all. Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did\nnot even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly\njoking to what went on later.\n\n“How can you say such things, Frances?” Cohn interrupted.\n\n“Listen to him. I’m going to England. I’m going to visit friends. Ever\nvisit friends that didn’t want you? Oh, they’ll have to take me, all\nright. ‘How do you do, my dear? Such a long time since we’ve seen you.\nAnd how is your dear mother?’ Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all\nher money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person\nin the world that did. ‘And what about Robert?’ or else very careful\ntalking around Robert. ‘You must be most careful not to mention him, my\ndear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.’ Won’t it be\nfun, Robert? Don’t you think it will be fun, Jake?”\n\nShe turned to me with that terribly bright smile. It was very\nsatisfactory to her to have an audience for this.\n\n“And where are you going to be, Robert? It’s my own fault, all right.\nPerfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary\non the magazine I ought to have known you’d get rid of me the same way.\nJake doesn’t know about that. Should I tell him?”\n\n“Shut up, Frances, for God’s sake.”\n\n“Yes, I’ll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine. Just\nthe sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was\nwonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful,\ntoo. So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to\nProvincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn’t even\npay her fare back to the coast. All to please me. He thought I was\npretty fine, then. Didn’t you, Robert?\n\n“You mustn’t misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the\nsecretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that\nshe was so nice. And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that\nwe that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn’t that\nliterary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert.\n\n“You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren’t you,\nRobert? That’s why he’s leaving me. He’s decided I don’t film well. You\nsee, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing\non this book, that he doesn’t remember anything about us. So now he’s\ngoing out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something\nfrightfully interesting."}
{"text": "“Listen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won’t mind, will\nyou? Don’t have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you\ncan’t have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you\ncan’t remember what the other person’s said. You’ll never be able to\nremember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm. I know it’s\nawfully hard. But remember, it’s for literature. We all ought to make\nsacrifices for literature. Look at me. I’m going to England without a\nprotest. All for literature. We must all help young writers. Don’t you\nthink so, Jake? But you’re not a young writer. Are you, Robert? You’re\nthirty-four. Still, I suppose that is young for a great writer. Look at\nHardy. Look at Anatole France. He just died a little while ago. Robert\ndoesn’t think he’s any good, though. Some of his French friends told\nhim. He doesn’t read French very well himself. He wasn’t a good writer\nlike you are, was he, Robert? Do you think he ever had to go and look\nfor material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he\nwouldn’t marry them? I wonder if he cried, too? Oh, I’ve just thought of\nsomething.” She put her gloved hand up to her lips. “I know the real\nreason why Robert won’t marry me, Jake. It’s just come to me. They’ve\nsent it to me in a vision in the Café Select. Isn’t it mystic? Some day\nthey’ll put a tablet up. Like at Lourdes. Do you want to hear, Robert?\nI’ll tell you. It’s so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it.\nWhy, you see, Robert’s always wanted to have a mistress, and if he\ndoesn’t marry me, why, then he’s had one. She was his mistress for over\ntwo years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he’s always\npromised he would, that would be the end of all the romance. Don’t you\nthink that’s bright of me to figure that out? It’s true, too. Look at\nhim and see if it’s not. Where are you going, Jake?”\n\n“I’ve got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute.”\n\nCohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there?\nWhy did he keep on taking it like that?\n\nAs I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the\nwindow. Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into\nhis face each time she asked: “Isn’t it so, Robert?” Or maybe she did\nnot ask that now. Perhaps she said something else. I told the barman I\ndid not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. As I\nwent out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and\nsaw them sitting there. She was still talking to him. I went down a side\nstreet to the Boulevard Raspail. A taxi came along and I got in and gave\nthe driver the address of my flat.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   7\n\nAs I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the\ndoor of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out. She had some letters\nand a telegram.\n\n“Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you.”\n\n“Did she leave a card?”\n\n“No. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night.\nIn the end I find she is very nice.”\n\n“Was she with a friend of mine?”\n\n“I don’t know. He was never here before. He was very large. Very, very\nlarge. She was very nice. Very, very nice. Last night she was, perhaps,\na little—” She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down.\n“I’ll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her\nnot so gentille. Last night I formed another idea of her. But listen to\nwhat I tell you. She is très, très gentille. She is of very good family.\nIt is a thing you can see.”\n\n“They did not leave any word?”\n\n“Yes. They said they would be back in an hour.”\n\n“Send them up when they come.”\n\n“Yes, Monsieur Barnes. And that lady, that lady there is some one. An\neccentric, perhaps, but quelqu’une, quelqu’une!”"}
{"text": "The concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-selling\nconcession at the Paris race-courses. Her life-work lay in the pelouse,\nbut she kept an eye on the people of the pesage, and she took great\npride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which were\nof good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with the\naccent on the men. The only trouble was that people who did not fall\ninto any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was\nno one home, chez Barnes. One of my friends, an extremely\nunderfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither\nwell brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter\nasking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could\ncome up and see me occasionally in the evenings.\n\nI went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge.\nThe wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the\n_France_. I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom,\nundressed and had a shower. I was rubbing down when I heard the\ndoor-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door.\nIt was Brett. Back of her was the count. He was holding a great bunch of\nroses.\n\n“Hello, darling,” said Brett. “Aren’t you going to let us in?”\n\n“Come on. I was just bathing.”\n\n“Aren’t you the fortunate man. Bathing.”\n\n“Only a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?”\n\n“I don’t know whether you like flowers, sir,” the count said, “but I\ntook the liberty of just bringing these roses.”\n\n“Here, give them to me.” Brett took them. “Get me some water in this,\nJake.” I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and\nBrett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the\ndining-room table.\n\n“I say. We have had a day.”\n\n“You don’t remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?”\n\n“No. Did we have one? I must have been blind.”\n\n“You were quite drunk, my dear,” said the count.\n\n“Wasn’t I, though? And the count’s been a brick, absolutely.”\n\n“You’ve got hell’s own drag with the concierge now.”\n\n“I ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs.”\n\n“Don’t be a damned fool.”\n\n“His,” she said, and nodded at the count.\n\n“I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It\nwas very late.”\n\n“He’s wonderful,” Brett said. “He remembers everything that’s happened.”\n\n“So do you, my dear.”\n\n“Fancy,” said Brett. “Who’d want to? I say, Jake, _do_ we get a drink?”\n\n“You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is.”\n\n“Rather.”\n\nWhile I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and\nthen heard them talking. I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt\ntired and pretty rotten. Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand,\nand sat on the bed.\n\n“What’s the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?”\n\nShe kissed me coolly on the forehead.\n\n“Oh, Brett, I love you so much.”\n\n“Darling,” she said. Then: “Do you want me to send him away?”\n\n“No. He’s nice.”\n\n“I’ll send him away.”\n\n“No, don’t.”\n\n“Yes, I’ll send him away.”\n\n“You can’t just like that.”\n\n“Can’t I, though? You stay here. He’s mad about me, I tell you.”\n\nShe was gone out of the room. I lay face down on the bed. I was having a\nbad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen. Brett came in and\nsat on the bed.\n\n“Poor old darling.” She stroked my head.\n\n“What did you say to him?” I was lying with my face away from her. I did\nnot want to see her.\n\n“Sent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne.”\n\nThen later: “Do you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?”\n\n“It’s better.”\n\n“Lie quiet. He’s gone to the other side of town.”\n\n“Couldn’t we live together, Brett? Couldn’t we just live together?”\n\n“I don’t think so. I’d just _tromper_ you with everybody. You couldn’t\nstand it.”\n\n“I stand it now.”\n\n“That would be different. It’s my fault, Jake. It’s the way I’m made.”\n\n“Couldn’t we go off in the country for a while?”\n\n“It wouldn’t be any good. I’ll go if you like. But I couldn’t live\nquietly in the country. Not with my own true love.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“Isn’t it rotten? There isn’t any use my telling you I love you.”\n\n“You know I love you.”\n\n“Let’s not talk. Talking’s all bilge. I’m going away from you, and then\nMichael’s coming back.”\n\n“Why are you going away?”"}
{"text": "“Better for you. Better for me.”\n\n“When are you going?”\n\n“Soon as I can.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“San Sebastian.”\n\n“Can’t we go together?”\n\n“No. That would be a hell of an idea after we’d just talked it out.”\n\n“We never agreed.”\n\n“Oh, you know as well as I do. Don’t be obstinate, darling.”\n\n“Oh, sure,” I said. “I know you’re right. I’m just low, and when I’m low\nI talk like a fool.”\n\nI sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on. I\nstood up.\n\n“Don’t look like that, darling.”\n\n“How do you want me to look?”\n\n“Oh, don’t be a fool. I’m going away to-morrow.”\n\n“To-morrow?”\n\n“Yes. Didn’t I say so? I am.”\n\n“Let’s have a drink, then. The count will be back.”\n\n“Yes. He should be back. You know he’s extraordinary about buying\nchampagne. It means any amount to him.”\n\nWe went into the dining-room. I took up the brandy bottle and poured\nBrett a drink and one for myself. There was a ring at the bell-pull. I\nwent to the door and there was the count. Behind him was the chauffeur\ncarrying a basket of champagne.\n\n“Where should I have him put it, sir?” asked the count.\n\n“In the kitchen,” Brett said.\n\n“Put it in there, Henry,” the count motioned. “Now go down and get the\nice.” He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door. “I\nthink you’ll find that’s very good wine,” he said. “I know we don’t get\nmuch of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this\nfrom a friend of mine that’s in the business.”\n\n“Oh, you always have some one in the trade,” Brett said.\n\n“This fellow raises the grapes. He’s got thousands of acres of them.”\n\n“What’s his name?” asked Brett. “Veuve Cliquot?”\n\n“No,” said the count. “Mumms. He’s a baron.”\n\n“Isn’t it wonderful,” said Brett. “We all have titles. Why haven’t you a\ntitle, Jake?”\n\n“I assure you, sir,” the count put his hand on my arm. “It never does a\nman any good. Most of the time it costs you money.”\n\n“Oh, I don’t know. It’s damned useful sometimes,” Brett said.\n\n“I’ve never known it to do me any good.”\n\n“You haven’t used it properly. I’ve had hell’s own amount of credit on\nmine.”\n\n“Do sit down, count,” I said. “Let me take that stick.”\n\nThe count was looking at Brett across the table under the gas-light. She\nwas smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me\nnotice it. “I say, Jake, I don’t want to ruin your rugs. Can’t you give\na chap an ash-tray?”\n\nI found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up\nwith a bucket full of salted ice. “Put two bottles in it, Henry,” the\ncount called.\n\n“Anything else, sir?”\n\n“No. Wait down in the car.” He turned to Brett and to me. “We’ll want to\nride out to the Bois for dinner?”\n\n“If you like,” Brett said. “I couldn’t eat a thing.”\n\n“I always like a good meal,” said the count.\n\n“Should I bring the wine in, sir?” asked the chauffeur.\n\n“Yes. Bring it in, Henry,” said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin\ncigar-case and offered it to me. “Like to try a real American cigar?”\n\n“Thanks,” I said. “I’ll finish the cigarette.”\n\nHe cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of\nhis watch-chain.\n\n“I like a cigar to really draw,” said the count “Half the cigars you\nsmoke don’t draw.”\n\nHe lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. “And\nwhen you’re divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won’t have a title.”\n\n“No. What a pity.”\n\n“No,” said the count. “You don’t need a title. You got class all over\nyou.”\n\n“Thanks. Awfully decent of you.”\n\n“I’m not joking you,” the count blew a cloud of smoke. “You got the most\nclass of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That’s all.”\n\n“Nice of you,” said Brett. “Mummy would be pleased. Couldn’t you write\nit out, and I’ll send it in a letter to her.”\n\n“I’d tell her, too,” said the count. “I’m not joking you. I never joke\npeople. Joke people and you make enemies. That’s what I always say.”\n\n“You’re right,” Brett said. “You’re terribly right. I always joke people\nand I haven’t a friend in the world. Except Jake here.”\n\n“You don’t joke him.”\n\n“That’s it.”\n\n“Do you, now?” asked the count. “Do you joke him?”\n\nBrett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes.\n\n“No,” she said. “I wouldn’t joke him.”\n\n“See,” said the count. “You don’t joke him.”\n\n“This is a hell of a dull talk,” Brett said. “How about some of that\nchampagne?”"}
{"text": "The count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket. “It\nisn’t cold, yet. You’re always drinking, my dear. Why don’t you just\ntalk?”\n\n“I’ve talked too ruddy much. I’ve talked myself all out to Jake.”\n\n“I should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you\nnever finish your sentences at all.”\n\n“Leave ’em for you to finish. Let any one finish them as they like.”\n\n“It is a very interesting system,” the count reached down and gave the\nbottles a twirl. “Still I would like to hear you talk some time.”\n\n“Isn’t he a fool?” Brett asked.\n\n“Now,” the count brought up a bottle. “I think this is cool.”\n\nI brought a towel and he wiped the bottle dry and held it up. “I like to\ndrink champagne from magnums. The wine is better but it would have been\ntoo hard to cool.” He held the bottle, looking at it. I put out the\nglasses.\n\n“I say. You might open it,” Brett suggested.\n\n“Yes, my dear. Now I’ll open it.”\n\nIt was amazing champagne.\n\n“I say that is wine,” Brett held up her glass. “We ought to toast\nsomething. ‘Here’s to royalty.’”\n\n“This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. You don’t want to\nmix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste.”\n\nBrett’s glass was empty.\n\n“You ought to write a book on wines, count,” I said.\n\n“Mr. Barnes,” answered the count, “all I want out of wines is to enjoy\nthem.”\n\n“Let’s enjoy a little more of this,” Brett pushed her glass forward. The\ncount poured very carefully. “There, my dear. Now you enjoy that slowly,\nand then you can get drunk.”\n\n“Drunk? Drunk?”\n\n“My dear, you are charming when you are drunk.”\n\n“Listen to the man.”\n\n“Mr. Barnes,” the count poured my glass full. “She is the only lady I\nhave ever known who was as charming when she was drunk as when she was\nsober.”\n\n“You haven’t been around much, have you?”\n\n“Yes, my dear. I have been around very much. I have been around a very\ngreat deal.”\n\n“Drink your wine,” said Brett. “We’ve all been around. I dare say Jake\nhere has seen as much as you have.”\n\n“My dear, I am sure Mr. Barnes has seen a lot. Don’t think I don’t think\nso, sir. I have seen a lot, too.”\n\n“Of course you have, my dear,” Brett said. “I was only ragging.”\n\n“I have been in seven wars and four revolutions,” the count said.\n\n“Soldiering?” Brett asked.\n\n“Sometimes, my dear. And I have got arrow wounds. Have you ever seen\narrow wounds?”\n\n“Let’s have a look at them.”\n\nThe count stood up, unbuttoned his vest, and opened his shirt. He pulled\nup the undershirt onto his chest and stood, his chest black, and big\nstomach muscles bulging under the light.\n\n“You see them?”\n\nBelow the line where his ribs stopped were two raised white welts. “See\non the back where they come out.” Above the small of the back were the\nsame two scars, raised as thick as a finger.\n\n“I say. Those are something.”\n\n“Clean through.”\n\nThe count was tucking in his shirt.\n\n“Where did you get those?” I asked.\n\n“In Abyssinia. When I was twenty-one years old.”\n\n“What were you doing?” asked Brett. “Were you in the army?”\n\n“I was on a business trip, my dear.”\n\n“I told you he was one of us. Didn’t I?” Brett turned to me. “I love\nyou, count. You’re a darling.”\n\n“You make me very happy, my dear. But it isn’t true.”\n\n“Don’t be an ass.”\n\n“You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I\ncan enjoy everything so well. Don’t you find it like that?”\n\n“Yes. Absolutely.”\n\n“I know,” said the count. “That is the secret. You must get to know the\nvalues.”\n\n“Doesn’t anything ever happen to your values?” Brett asked.\n\n“No. Not any more.”\n\n“Never fall in love?”\n\n“Always,” said the count. “I am always in love.”\n\n“What does that do to your values?”\n\n“That, too, has got a place in my values.”\n\n“You haven’t any values. You’re dead, that’s all.”\n\n“No, my dear. You’re not right. I’m not dead at all.”\n\nWe drank three bottles of the champagne and the count left the basket in\nmy kitchen. We dined at a restaurant in the Bois. It was a good dinner.\nFood had an excellent place in the count’s values. So did wine. The\ncount was in fine form during the meal. So was Brett. It was a good\nparty.\n\n“Where would you like to go?” asked the count after dinner. We were the\nonly people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over\nagainst the door. They wanted to go home."}
{"text": "“We might go up on the hill,” Brett said. “Haven’t we had a splendid\nparty?”\n\nThe count was beaming. He was very happy.\n\n“You are very nice people,” he said. He was smoking a cigar again. “Why\ndon’t you get married, you two?”\n\n“We want to lead our own lives,” I said.\n\n“We have our careers,” Brett said. “Come on. Let’s get out of this.”\n\n“Have another brandy,” the count said.\n\n“Get it on the hill.”\n\n“No. Have it here where it is quiet.”\n\n“You and your quiet,” said Brett. “What is it men feel about quiet?”\n\n“We like it,” said the count. “Like you like noise, my dear.”\n\n“All right,” said Brett. “Let’s have one.”\n\n“Sommelier!” the count called.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“What is the oldest brandy you have?”\n\n“Eighteen eleven, sir.”\n\n“Bring us a bottle.”\n\n“I say. Don’t be ostentatious. Call him off, Jake.”\n\n“Listen, my dear. I get more value for my money in old brandy than in\nany other antiquities.”\n\n“Got many antiquities?”\n\n“I got a houseful.”\n\nFinally we went up to Montmartre. Inside Zelli’s it was crowded, smoky,\nand noisy. The music hit you as you went in. Brett and I danced. It was\nso crowded we could barely move. The nigger drummer waved at Brett. We\nwere caught in the jam, dancing in one place in front of him.\n\n“Hahre you?”\n\n“Great.”\n\n“Thaats good.”\n\nHe was all teeth and lips.\n\n“He’s a great friend of mine,” Brett said. “Damn good drummer.”\n\nThe music stopped and we started toward the table where the count sat.\nThen the music started again and we danced. I looked at the count. He\nwas sitting at the table smoking a cigar. The music stopped again.\n\n“Let’s go over.”\n\nBrett started toward the table. The music started and again we danced,\ntight in the crowd.\n\n“You are a rotten dancer, Jake. Michael’s the best dancer I know.”\n\n“He’s splendid.”\n\n“He’s got his points.”\n\n“I like him,” I said. “I’m damned fond of him.”\n\n“I’m going to marry him,” Brett said. “Funny. I haven’t thought about\nhim for a week.”\n\n“Don’t you write him?”\n\n“Not I. Never write letters.”\n\n“I’ll bet he writes to you.”\n\n“Rather. Damned good letters, too.”\n\n“When are you going to get married?”\n\n“How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael’s trying to\nget his mother to put up for it.”\n\n“Could I help you?”\n\n“Don’t be an ass. Michael’s people have loads of money.”\n\nThe music stopped. We walked over to the table. The count stood up.\n\n“Very nice,” he said. “You looked very, very nice.”\n\n“Don’t you dance, count?” I asked.\n\n“No. I’m too old.”\n\n“Oh, come off it,” Brett said.\n\n“My dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you\ndance.”\n\n“Splendid,” Brett said. “I’ll dance again for you some time. I say. What\nabout your little friend, Zizi?”\n\n“Let me tell you. I support that boy, but I don’t want to have him\naround.”\n\n“He is rather hard.”\n\n“You know I think that boy’s got a future. But personally I don’t want\nhim around.”\n\n“Jake’s rather the same way.”\n\n“He gives me the willys.”\n\n“Well,” the count shrugged his shoulders. “About his future you can’t\never tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father.”\n\n“Come on. Let’s dance,” Brett said.\n\nWe danced. It was crowded and close.\n\n“Oh, darling,” Brett said, “I’m so miserable.”\n\nI had that feeling of going through something that has all happened\nbefore. “You were happy a minute ago.”\n\nThe drummer shouted: “You can’t two time—”\n\n“It’s all gone.”\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“I don’t know. I just feel terribly.”\n\n“. . . . . .” the drummer chanted. Then turned to his sticks.\n\n“Want to go?”\n\nI had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated,\nsomething I had been through and that now I must go through again.\n\n“. . . . . .” the drummer sang softly.\n\n“Let’s go,” said Brett. “You don’t mind.”\n\n“. . . . . .” the drummer shouted and grinned at Brett.\n\n“All right,” I said. We got out from the crowd. Brett went to the\ndressing-room.\n\n“Brett wants to go,” I said to the count. He nodded. “Does she? That’s\nfine. You take the car. I’m going to stay here for a while, Mr. Barnes.”\n\nWe shook hands.\n\n“It was a wonderful time,” I said. “I wish you would let me get this.” I\ntook a note out of my pocket.\n\n“Mr. Barnes, don’t be ridiculous,” the count said."}
{"text": "Brett came over with her wrap on. She kissed the count and put her hand\non his shoulder to keep him from standing up. As we went out the door I\nlooked back and there were three girls at his table. We got into the big\ncar. Brett gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel.\n\n“No, don’t come up,” she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door\nwas unlatched.\n\n“Really?”\n\n“No. Please.”\n\n“Good night, Brett,” I said. “I’m sorry you feel rotten.”\n\n“Good night, Jake. Good night, darling. I won’t see you again.” We\nkissed standing at the door. She pushed me away. We kissed again. “Oh,\ndon’t!” Brett said.\n\nShe turned quickly and went into the hotel. The chauffeur drove me\naround to my flat. I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap and\nsaid: “Good night, sir,” and drove off. I rang the bell. The door opened\nand I went up-stairs and went to bed.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   8\n\nI did not see Brett again until she came back from San Sebastian. One\ncard came from her from there. It had a picture of the Concha, and said:\n“Darling. Very quiet and healthy. Love to all the chaps. BRETT.”\n\nNor did I see Robert Cohn again. I heard Frances had left for England\nand I had a note from Cohn saying he was going out in the country for a\ncouple of weeks, he did not know where, but that he wanted to hold me to\nthe fishing-trip in Spain we had talked about last winter. I could reach\nhim always, he wrote, through his bankers.\n\nBrett was gone, I was not bothered by Cohn’s troubles, I rather enjoyed\nnot having to play tennis, there was plenty of work to do, I went often\nto the races, dined with friends, and put in some extra time at the\noffice getting things ahead so I could leave it in charge of my\nsecretary when Bill Gorton and I should shove off to Spain the end of\nJune. Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went\noff to Vienna. He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful.\nNew York was wonderful. There had been a grand theatrical season and a\nwhole crop of great young light heavyweights. Any one of them was a good\nprospect to grow up, put on weight and trim Dempsey. Bill was very\nhappy. He had made a lot of money on his last book, and was going to\nmake a lot more. We had a good time while he was in Paris, and then he\nwent off to Vienna. He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave\nfor Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona. He\nwrote that Vienna was wonderful. Then a card from Budapest: “Jake,\nBudapest is wonderful.” Then I got a wire: “Back on Monday.”\n\nMonday evening he turned up at the flat. I heard his taxi stop and went\nto the window and called to him; he waved and started up-stairs carrying\nhis bags. I met him on the stairs, and took one of the bags.\n\n“Well,” I said, “I hear you had a wonderful trip.”\n\n“Wonderful,” he said. “Budapest is absolutely wonderful.”\n\n“How about Vienna?”\n\n“Not so good, Jake. Not so good. It seemed better than it was.”\n\n“How do you mean?” I was getting glasses and a siphon.\n\n“Tight, Jake. I was tight.”\n\n“That’s strange. Better have a drink.”\n\nBill rubbed his forehead. “Remarkable thing,” he said. “Don’t know how\nit happened. Suddenly it happened.”\n\n“Last long?”\n\n“Four days, Jake. Lasted just four days.”\n\n“Where did you go?”\n\n“Don’t remember. Wrote you a post-card. Remember that perfectly.”\n\n“Do anything else?”\n\n“Not so sure. Possible.”\n\n“Go on. Tell me about it.”\n\n“Can’t remember. Tell you anything I could remember.”\n\n“Go on. Take that drink and remember.”\n\n“Might remember a little,” Bill said. “Remember something about a\nprize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember\nthe nigger perfectly.”\n\n“Go on.”\n\n“Wonderful nigger. Looked like Tiger Flowers, only four times as big.\nAll of a sudden everybody started to throw things. Not me. Nigger’d just\nknocked local boy down. Nigger put up his glove. Wanted to make a\nspeech. Awful noble-looking nigger. Started to make a speech. Then local\nwhite boy hit him. Then he knocked white boy cold. Then everybody\ncommenced to throw chairs. Nigger went home with us in our car. Couldn’t\nget his clothes. Wore my coat. Remember the whole thing now. Big\nsporting evening.”\n\n“What happened?”"}
{"text": "“Loaned the nigger some clothes and went around with him to try and get\nhis money. Claimed nigger owed them money on account of wrecking hall.\nWonder who translated? Was it me?”\n\n“Probably it wasn’t you.”\n\n“You’re right. Wasn’t me at all. Was another fellow. Think we called him\nthe local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music.”\n\n“How’d you come out?”\n\n“Not so good, Jake. Injustice everywhere. Promoter claimed nigger\npromised let local boy stay. Claimed nigger violated contract. Can’t\nknock out Vienna boy in Vienna. ‘My God, Mister Gorton,’ said nigger, ‘I\ndidn’t do nothing in there for forty minutes but try and let him stay.\nThat white boy musta ruptured himself swinging at me. I never did hit\nhim.’”\n\n“Did you get any money?”\n\n“No money, Jake. All we could get was nigger’s clothes. Somebody took\nhis watch, too. Splendid nigger. Big mistake to have come to Vienna. Not\nso good, Jake. Not so good.”\n\n“What became of the nigger?”\n\n“Went back to Cologne. Lives there. Married. Got a family. Going to\nwrite me a letter and send me the money I loaned him. Wonderful nigger.\nHope I gave him the right address.”\n\n“You probably did.”\n\n“Well, anyway, let’s eat,” said Bill. “Unless you want me to tell you\nsome more travel stories.”\n\n“Go on.”\n\n“Let’s eat.”\n\nWe went down-stairs and out onto the Boulevard St. Michel in the warm\nJune evening.\n\n“Where will we go?”\n\n“Want to eat on the island?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\nWe walked down the Boulevard. At the juncture of the Rue\nDenfert-Rochereau with the Boulevard is a statue of two men in flowing\nrobes.\n\n“I know who they are.” Bill eyed the monument. “Gentlemen who invented\npharmacy. Don’t try and fool me on Paris.”\n\nWe went on.\n\n“Here’s a taxidermist’s,” Bill said. “Want to buy anything? Nice stuffed\ndog?”\n\n“Come on,” I said. “You’re pie-eyed.”\n\n“Pretty nice stuffed dogs,” Bill said. “Certainly brighten up your\nflat.”\n\n“Come on.”\n\n“Just one stuffed dog. I can take ’em or leave ’em alone. But listen,\nJake. Just one stuffed dog.”\n\n“Come on.”\n\n“Mean everything in the world to you after you bought it. Simple\nexchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog.”\n\n“We’ll get one on the way back.”\n\n“All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with unbought\nstuffed dogs. Not my fault.”\n\nWe went on.\n\n“How’d you feel that way about dogs so sudden?”\n\n“Always felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed\nanimals.”\n\nWe stopped and had a drink.\n\n“Certainly like to drink,” Bill said. “You ought to try it some times,\nJake.”\n\n“You’re about a hundred and forty-four ahead of me.”\n\n“Ought not to daunt you. Never be daunted. Secret of my success. Never\nbeen daunted. Never been daunted in public.”\n\n“Where were you drinking?”\n\n“Stopped at the Crillon. George made me a couple of Jack Roses. George’s\na great man. Know the secret of his success? Never been daunted.”\n\n“You’ll be daunted after about three more pernods.”\n\n“Not in public. If I begin to feel daunted I’ll go off by myself. I’m\nlike a cat that way.”\n\n“When did you see Harvey Stone?”\n\n“At the Crillon. Harvey was just a little daunted. Hadn’t eaten for\nthree days. Doesn’t eat any more. Just goes off like a cat. Pretty sad.”\n\n“He’s all right.”\n\n“Splendid. Wish he wouldn’t keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me\nnervous.”\n\n“What’ll we do to-night?”\n\n“Doesn’t make any difference. Only let’s not get daunted. Suppose they\ngot any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we\nwouldn’t have to go all the way down to the island to eat.”\n\n“Nix,” I said. “We’re going to have a regular meal.”\n\n“Just a suggestion,” said Bill. “Want to start now?”\n\n“Come on.”\n\nWe started on again down the Boulevard. A horse-cab passed us. Bill\nlooked at it.\n\n“See that horse-cab? Going to have that horse-cab stuffed for you for\nChristmas. Going to give all my friends stuffed animals. I’m a\nnature-writer.”\n\nA taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop.\nThe taxi backed up to the curb. In it was Brett.\n\n“Beautiful lady,” said Bill. “Going to kidnap us.”\n\n“Hullo!” Brett said. “Hullo!”\n\n“This is Bill Gorton. Lady Ashley.”\n\nBrett smiled at Bill. “I say I’m just back. Haven’t bathed even. Michael\ncomes in to-night.”\n\n“Good. Come on and eat with us, and we’ll all go to meet him.”\n\n“Must clean myself.”\n\n“Oh, rot! Come on.”"}
{"text": "“Must bathe. He doesn’t get in till nine.”\n\n“Come and have a drink, then, before you bathe.”\n\n“Might do that. Now you’re not talking rot.”\n\nWe got in the taxi. The driver looked around.\n\n“Stop at the nearest bistro,” I said.\n\n“We might as well go to the Closerie,” Brett said. “I can’t drink these\nrotten brandies.”\n\n“Closerie des Lilas.”\n\nBrett turned to Bill.\n\n“Have you been in this pestilential city long?”\n\n“Just got in to-day from Budapest.”\n\n“How was Budapest?”\n\n“Wonderful. Budapest was wonderful.”\n\n“Ask him about Vienna.”\n\n“Vienna,” said Bill, “is a strange city.”\n\n“Very much like Paris,” Brett smiled at him, wrinkling the corners of\nher eyes.\n\n“Exactly,” Bill said. “Very much like Paris at this moment.”\n\n“You _have_ a good start.”\n\nSitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and\nsoda, I took one, too, and Bill took another pernod.\n\n“How are you, Jake?”\n\n“Great,” I said. “I’ve had a good time.”\n\nBrett looked at me. “I was a fool to go away,” she said. “One’s an ass\nto leave Paris.”\n\n“Did you have a good time?”\n\n“Oh, all right. Interesting. Not frightfully amusing.”\n\n“See anybody?”\n\n“No, hardly anybody. I never went out.”\n\n“Didn’t you swim?”\n\n“No. Didn’t do a thing.”\n\n“Sounds like Vienna,” Bill said.\n\nBrett wrinkled up the corners of her eyes at him.\n\n“So that’s the way it was in Vienna.”\n\n“It was like everything in Vienna.”\n\nBrett smiled at him again.\n\n“You’ve a nice friend, Jake.”\n\n“He’s all right,” I said. “He’s a taxidermist.”\n\n“That was in another country,” Bill said. “And besides all the animals\nwere dead.”\n\n“One more,” Brett said, “and I must run. Do send the waiter for a taxi.”\n\n“There’s a line of them. Right out in front.”\n\n“Good.”\n\nWe had the drink and put Brett into her taxi.\n\n“Mind you’re at the Select around ten. Make him come. Michael will be\nthere.”\n\n“We’ll be there,” Bill said. The taxi started and Brett waved.\n\n“Quite a girl,” Bill said. “She’s damned nice. Who’s Michael?”\n\n“The man she’s going to marry.”\n\n“Well, well,” Bill said. “That’s always just the stage I meet anybody.\nWhat’ll I send them? Think they’d like a couple of stuffed race-horses?”\n\n“We better eat.”\n\n“Is she really Lady something or other?” Bill asked in the taxi on our\nway down to the Ile Saint Louis.\n\n“Oh, yes. In the stud-book and everything.”\n\n“Well, well.”\n\nWe ate dinner at Madame Lecomte’s restaurant on the far side of the\nisland. It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait\nfor a place. Some one had put it in the American Women’s Club list as a\nquaint restaurant on the Paris quais as yet untouched by Americans, so\nwe had to wait forty-five minutes for a table. Bill had eaten at the\nrestaurant in 1918, and right after the armistice, and Madame Lecomte\nmade a great fuss over seeing him.\n\n“Doesn’t get us a table, though,” Bill said. “Grand woman, though.”\n\nWe had a good meal, a roast chicken, new green beans, mashed potatoes, a\nsalad, and some apple-pie and cheese.\n\n“You’ve got the world here all right,” Bill said to Madame Lecomte. She\nraised her hand. “Oh, my God!”\n\n“You’ll be rich.”\n\n“I hope so.”\n\nAfter the coffee and a _fine_ we got the bill, chalked up the same as\never on a slate, that was doubtless one of the “quaint” features, paid\nit, shook hands, and went out.\n\n“You never come here any more, Monsieur Barnes,” Madame Lecomte said.\n\n“Too many compatriots.”\n\n“Come at lunch-time. It’s not crowded then.”\n\n“Good. I’ll be down soon.”\n\nWe walked along under the trees that grew out over the river on the Quai\nd’Orléans side of the island. Across the river were the broken walls of\nold houses that were being torn down.\n\n“They’re going to cut a street through.”\n\n“They would,” Bill said.\n\nWe walked on and circled the island. The river was dark and a bateau\nmouche went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out\nof sight under the bridge. Down the river was Notre Dame squatting\nagainst the night sky. We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the\nwooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge\nand looked down the river at Notre Dame. Standing on the bridge the\nisland looked dark, the houses were high against the sky, and the trees\nwere shadows.\n\n“It’s pretty grand,” Bill said. “God, I love to get back.”"}
{"text": "We leaned on the wooden rail of the bridge and looked up the river to\nthe lights of the big bridges. Below the water was smooth and black. It\nmade no sound against the piles of the bridge. A man and a girl passed\nus. They were walking with their arms around each other.\n\nWe crossed the bridge and walked up the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine. It was\nsteep walking, and we went all the way up to the Place Contrescarpe. The\narc-light shone through the leaves of the trees in the square, and\nunderneath the trees was an S bus ready to start. Music came out of the\ndoor of the Negre Joyeux. Through the window of the Café Aux Amateurs I\nsaw the long zinc bar. Outside on the terrace working people were\ndrinking. In the open kitchen of the Amateurs a girl was cooking\npotato-chips in oil. There was an iron pot of stew. The girl ladled some\nonto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in\none hand.\n\n“Want to have a drink?”\n\n“No,” said Bill. “I don’t need it.”\n\nWe turned to the right off the Place Contrescarpe, walking along smooth\nnarrow streets with high old houses on both sides. Some of the houses\njutted out toward the street. Others were cut back. We came onto the Rue\ndu Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid\nnorth and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south, past Val\nde Grâce, set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the\nBoulevard du Port Royal.\n\n“What do you want to do?” I asked. “Go up to the café and see Brett and\nMike?”\n\n“Why not?”\n\nWe walked along Port Royal until it became Montparnasse, and then on\npast the Lilas, Lavigne’s, and all the little cafés, Damoy’s, crossed\nthe street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select.\n\nMichael came toward us from the tables. He was tanned and\nhealthy-looking.\n\n“Hel-lo, Jake,” he said. “Hel-lo! Hel-lo! How are you, old lad?”\n\n“You look very fit, Mike.”\n\n“Oh, I am. I’m frightfully fit. I’ve done nothing but walk. Walk all day\nlong. One drink a day with my mother at tea.”\n\nBill had gone into the bar. He was standing talking with Brett, who was\nsitting on a high stool, her legs crossed. She had no stockings on.\n\n“It’s good to see you, Jake,” Michael said. “I’m a little tight you\nknow. Amazing, isn’t it? Did you see my nose?”\n\nThere was a patch of dried blood on the bridge of his nose.\n\n“An old lady’s bags did that,” Mike said. “I reached up to help her with\nthem and they fell on me.”\n\nBrett gestured at him from the bar with her cigarette-holder and\nwrinkled the corners of her eyes.\n\n“An old lady,” said Mike. “Her bags _fell_ on me. Let’s go in and see\nBrett. I say, she is a piece. You _are_ a lovely lady, Brett. Where did\nyou get that hat?”\n\n“Chap bought it for me. Don’t you like it?”\n\n“It’s a dreadful hat. Do get a good hat.”\n\n“Oh, we’ve so much money now,” Brett said. “I say, haven’t you met Bill\nyet? You _are_ a lovely host, Jake.”\n\nShe turned to Mike. “This is Bill Gorton. This drunkard is Mike\nCampbell. Mr. Campbell is an undischarged bankrupt.”\n\n“Aren’t I, though? You know I met my ex-partner yesterday in London.\nChap who did me in.”\n\n“What did he say?”\n\n“Bought me a drink. I thought I might as well take it. I say, Brett, you\n_are_ a lovely piece. Don’t you think she’s beautiful?”\n\n“Beautiful. With this nose?”\n\n“It’s a lovely nose. Go on, point it at me. Isn’t she a lovely piece?”\n\n“Couldn’t we have kept the man in Scotland?”\n\n“I say, Brett, let’s turn in early.”\n\n“Don’t be indecent, Michael. Remember there are ladies at this bar.”\n\n“Isn’t she a lovely piece? Don’t you think so, Jake?”\n\n“There’s a fight to-night,” Bill said. “Like to go?”\n\n“Fight,” said Mike. “Who’s fighting?”\n\n“Ledoux and somebody.”\n\n“He’s very good, Ledoux,” Mike said. “I’d like to see it, rather”—he\nwas making an effort to pull himself together—“but I can’t go. I had a\ndate with this thing here. I say, Brett, do get a new hat.”\n\nBrett pulled the felt hat down far over one eye and smiled out from\nunder it. “You two run along to the fight. I’ll have to be taking Mr.\nCampbell home directly.”\n\n“I’m not tight,” Mike said. “Perhaps just a little. I say, Brett, you\nare a lovely piece.”"}
{"text": "“Go on to the fight,” Brett said. “Mr. Campbell’s getting difficult.\nWhat are these outbursts of affection, Michael?”\n\n“I say, you are a lovely piece.”\n\nWe said good night. “I’m sorry I can’t go,” Mike said. Brett laughed. I\nlooked back from the door. Mike had one hand on the bar and was leaning\ntoward Brett, talking. Brett was looking at him quite coolly, but the\ncorners of her eyes were smiling.\n\nOutside on the pavement I said: “Do you want to go to the fight?”\n\n“Sure,” said Bill. “If we don’t have to walk.”\n\n“Mike was pretty excited about his girl friend,” I said in the taxi.\n\n“Well,” said Bill. “You can’t blame him such a hell of a lot.”\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   9\n\nThe Ledoux-Kid Francis fight was the night of the 20th of June. It was a\ngood fight. The morning after the fight I had a letter from Robert Cohn,\nwritten from Hendaye. He was having a very quiet time, he said, bathing,\nplaying some golf and much bridge. Hendaye had a splendid beach, but he\nwas anxious to start on the fishing-trip. When would I be down? If I\nwould buy him a double-tapered line he would pay me when I came down.\n\nThat same morning I wrote Cohn from the office that Bill and I would\nleave Paris on the 25th unless I wired him otherwise, and would meet him\nat Bayonne, where we could get a bus over the mountains to Pamplona. The\nsame evening about seven o’clock I stopped in at the Select to see\nMichael and Brett. They were not there, and I went over to the Dingo.\nThey were inside sitting at the bar.\n\n“Hello, darling.” Brett put out her hand.\n\n“Hello, Jake,” Mike said. “I understand I was tight last night.”\n\n“Weren’t you, though,” Brett said. “Disgraceful business.”\n\n“Look,” said Mike, “when do you go down to Spain? Would you mind if we\ncame down with you?”\n\n“It would be grand.”\n\n“You wouldn’t mind, really? I’ve been at Pamplona, you know. Brett’s mad\nto go. You’re sure we wouldn’t just be a bloody nuisance?”\n\n“Don’t talk like a fool.”\n\n“I’m a little tight, you know. I wouldn’t ask you like this if I\nweren’t. You’re sure you don’t mind?”\n\n“Oh, shut up, Michael,” Brett said. “How can the man say he’d mind now?\nI’ll ask him later.”\n\n“But you don’t mind, do you?”\n\n“Don’t ask that again unless you want to make me sore. Bill and I go\ndown on the morning of the 25th.”\n\n“By the way, where is Bill?” Brett asked.\n\n“He’s out at Chantilly dining with some people.”\n\n“He’s a good chap.”\n\n“Splendid chap,” said Mike. “He is, you know.”\n\n“You don’t remember him,” Brett said.\n\n“I do. Remember him perfectly. Look, Jake, we’ll come down the night of\nthe 25th. Brett can’t get up in the morning.”\n\n“Indeed not!”\n\n“If our money comes and you’re sure you don’t mind.”\n\n“It will come, all right. I’ll see to that.”\n\n“Tell me what tackle to send for.”\n\n“Get two or three rods with reels, and lines, and some flies.”\n\n“I won’t fish,” Brett put in.\n\n“Get two rods, then, and Bill won’t have to buy one.”\n\n“Right,” said Mike. “I’ll send a wire to the keeper.”\n\n“Won’t it be splendid,” Brett said. “Spain! We _will_ have fun.”\n\n“The 25th. When is that?”\n\n“Saturday.”\n\n“We _will_ have to get ready.”\n\n“I say,” said Mike, “I’m going to the barber’s.”\n\n“I must bathe,” said Brett. “Walk up to the hotel with me, Jake. Be a\ngood chap.”\n\n“We _have_ got the loveliest hotel,” Mike said. “I think it’s a\nbrothel!”\n\n“We left our bags here at the Dingo when we got in, and they asked us at\nthis hotel if we wanted a room for the afternoon only. Seemed\nfrightfully pleased we were going to stay all night.”\n\n“_I_ believe it’s a brothel,” Mike said. “And _I_ should know.”\n\n“Oh, shut it and go and get your hair cut.”\n\nMike went out. Brett and I sat on at the bar.\n\n“Have another?”\n\n“Might.”\n\n“I needed that,” Brett said.\n\nWe walked up the Rue Delambre.\n\n“I haven’t seen you since I’ve been back,” Brett said.\n\n“No.”\n\n“How _are_ you, Jake?”\n\n“Fine.”\n\nBrett looked at me. “I say,” she said, “is Robert Cohn going on this\ntrip?”\n\n“Yes. Why?”\n\n“Don’t you think it will be a bit rough on him?”\n\n“Why should it?”\n\n“Who did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?”\n\n“Congratulations,” I said.\n\nWe walked along.\n\n“What did you say that for?”\n\n“I don’t know. What would you like me to say?”\n\nWe walked along and turned a corner.\n\n“He behaved rather well, too. He gets a little dull.”\n\n“Does he?”"}
{"text": "“I rather thought it would be good for him.”\n\n“You might take up social service.”\n\n“Don’t be nasty.”\n\n“I won’t.”\n\n“Didn’t you really know?”\n\n“No,” I said. “I guess I didn’t think about it.”\n\n“Do you think it will be too rough on him?”\n\n“That’s up to him,” I said. “Tell him you’re coming. He can always not\ncome.”\n\n“I’ll write him and give him a chance to pull out of it.”\n\nI did not see Brett again until the night of the 24th of June.\n\n“Did you hear from Cohn?”\n\n“Rather. He’s keen about it.”\n\n“My God!”\n\n“I thought it was rather odd myself.”\n\n“Says he can’t wait to see me.”\n\n“Does he think you’re coming alone?”\n\n“No. I told him we were all coming down together. Michael and all.”\n\n“He’s wonderful.”\n\n“Isn’t he?”\n\nThey expected their money the next day. We arranged to meet at Pamplona.\nThey would go directly to San Sebastian and take the train from there.\nWe would all meet at the Montoya in Pamplona. If they did not turn up on\nMonday at the latest we would go on ahead up to Burguete in the\nmountains, to start fishing. There was a bus to Burguete. I wrote out an\nitinerary so they could follow us.\n\nBill and I took the morning train from the Gare d’Orsay. It was a lovely\nday, not too hot, and the country was beautiful from the start. We went\nback into the diner and had breakfast. Leaving the dining-car I asked\nthe conductor for tickets for the first service.\n\n“Nothing until the fifth.”\n\n“What’s this?”\n\nThere were never more than two servings of lunch on that train, and\nalways plenty of places for both of them.\n\n“They’re all reserved,” the dining-car conductor said. “There will be a\nfifth service at three-thirty.”\n\n“This is serious,” I said to Bill.\n\n“Give him ten francs.”\n\n“Here,” I said. “We want to eat in the first service.”\n\nThe conductor put the ten francs in his pocket.\n\n“Thank you,” he said. “I would advise you gentlemen to get some\nsandwiches. All the places for the first four services were reserved at\nthe office of the company.”\n\n“You’ll go a long way, brother,” Bill said to him in English. “I suppose\nif I’d given you five francs you would have advised us to jump off the\ntrain.”\n\n“_Comment?_”\n\n“Go to hell!” said Bill. “Get the sandwiches made and a bottle of wine.\nYou tell him, Jake.”\n\n“And send it up to the next car.” I described where we were.\n\nIn our compartment were a man and his wife and their young son.\n\n“I suppose you’re Americans, aren’t you?” the man asked. “Having a good\ntrip?”\n\n“Wonderful,” said Bill.\n\n“That’s what you want to do. Travel while you’re young. Mother and I\nalways wanted to get over, but we had to wait a while.”\n\n“You could have come over ten years ago, if you’d wanted to,” the wife\nsaid. “What you always said was: ‘See America first!’ I will say we’ve\nseen a good deal, take it one way and another.”\n\n“Say, there’s plenty of Americans on this train,” the husband said.\n“They’ve got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They’ve been on a\npilgrimage to Rome, and now they’re going down to Biarritz and Lourdes.”\n\n“So, that’s what they are. Pilgrims. Goddam Puritans,” Bill said.\n\n“What part of the States you boys from?”\n\n“Kansas City,” I said. “He’s from Chicago.”\n\n“You both going to Biarritz?”\n\n“No. We’re going fishing in Spain.”\n\n“Well, I never cared for it, myself. There’s plenty that do out where I\ncome from, though. We got some of the best fishing in the State of\nMontana. I’ve been out with the boys, but I never cared for it any.”\n\n“Mighty little fishing you did on them trips,” his wife said.\n\nHe winked at us.\n\n“You know how the ladies are. If there’s a jug goes along, or a case of\nbeer, they think it’s hell and damnation.”\n\n“That’s the way men are,” his wife said to us. She smoothed her\ncomfortable lap. “I voted against prohibition to please him, and because\nI like a little beer in the house, and then he talks that way. It’s a\nwonder they ever find any one to marry them.”\n\n“Say,” said Bill, “do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have\ncornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?”\n\n“How do you mean? They can’t do a thing like that.”\n\n“You try and get seats.”\n\n“Well, mother, it looks as though we better go back and get another\nbreakfast.”\n\nShe stood up and straightened her dress.\n\n“Will you boys keep an eye on our things? Come on, Hubert.”"}
{"text": "They all three went up to the wagon restaurant. A little while after\nthey were gone a steward went through announcing the first service, and\npilgrims, with their priests, commenced filing down the corridor. Our\nfriend and his family did not come back. A waiter passed in the corridor\nwith our sandwiches and the bottle of Chablis, and we called him in.\n\n“You’re going to work to-day,” I said.\n\nHe nodded his head. “They start now, at ten-thirty.”\n\n“When do we eat?”\n\n“Huh! When do I eat?”\n\nHe left two glasses for the bottle, and we paid him for the sandwiches\nand tipped him.\n\n“I’ll get the plates,” he said, “or bring them with you.”\n\nWe ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out\nof the window. The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were\nfull of poppies. The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees,\nand sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees.\n\nAt Tours we got off and bought another bottle of wine, and when we got\nback in the compartment the gentleman from Montana and his wife and his\nson, Hubert, were sitting comfortably.\n\n“Is there good swimming in Biarritz?” asked Hubert.\n\n“That boy’s just crazy till he can get in the water,” his mother said.\n“It’s pretty hard on youngsters travelling.”\n\n“There’s good swimming,” I said. “But it’s dangerous when it’s rough.”\n\n“Did you get a meal?” Bill asked.\n\n“We sure did. We set right there when they started to come in, and they\nmust have just thought we were in the party. One of the waiters said\nsomething to us in French, and then they just sent three of them back.”\n\n“They thought we were snappers, all right,” the man said. “It certainly\nshows you the power of the Catholic Church. It’s a pity you boys ain’t\nCatholics. You could get a meal, then, all right.”\n\n“I am,” I said. “That’s what makes me so sore.”\n\nFinally at a quarter past four we had lunch. Bill had been rather\ndifficult at the last. He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with\none of the returning streams of pilgrims.\n\n“When do us Protestants get a chance to eat, father?”\n\n“I don’t know anything about it. Haven’t you got tickets?”\n\n“It’s enough to make a man join the Klan,” Bill said. The priest looked\nback at him.\n\nInside the dining-car the waiters served the fifth successive table\nd’hôte meal. The waiter who served us was soaked through. His white\njacket was purple under the arms.\n\n“He must drink a lot of wine.”\n\n“Or wear purple undershirts.”\n\n“Let’s ask him.”\n\n“No. He’s too tired.”\n\nThe train stopped for half an hour at Bordeaux and we went out through\nthe station for a little walk. There was not time to get in to the town.\nAfterward we passed through the Landes and watched the sun set. There\nwere wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them\nlike avenues and see wooded hills way off. About seven-thirty we had\ndinner and watched the country through the open window in the diner. It\nwas all sandy pine country full of heather. There were little clearings\nwith houses in them, and once in a while we passed a sawmill. It got\ndark and we could feel the country hot and sandy and dark outside of the\nwindow, and about nine o’clock we got into Bayonne. The man and his wife\nand Hubert all shook hands with us. They were going on to LaNegresse to\nchange for Biarritz.\n\n“Well, I hope you have lots of luck,” he said.\n\n“Be careful about those bull-fights.”\n\n“Maybe we’ll see you at Biarritz,” Hubert said.\n\nWe got off with our bags and rod-cases and passed through the dark\nstation and out to the lights and the line of cabs and hotel buses.\nThere, standing with the hotel runners, was Robert Cohn. He did not see\nus at first. Then he started forward.\n\n“Hello, Jake. Have a good trip?”\n\n“Fine,” I said. “This is Bill Gorton.”\n\n“How are you?”\n\n“Come on,” said Robert. “I’ve got a cab.” He was a little near-sighted.\nI had never noticed it before. He was looking at Bill, trying to make\nhim out. He was shy, too.\n\n“We’ll go up to my hotel. It’s all right. It’s quite nice.”\n\nWe got into the cab, and the cabman put the bags up on the seat beside\nhim and climbed up and cracked his whip, and we drove over the dark\nbridge and into the town."}
{"text": "“I’m awfully glad to meet you,” Robert said to Bill. “I’ve heard so much\nabout you from Jake and I’ve read your books. Did you get my line,\nJake?”\n\nThe cab stopped in front of the hotel and we all got out and went in. It\nwas a nice hotel, and the people at the desk were very cheerful, and we\neach had a good small room.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   10\n\nIn the morning it was bright, and they were sprinkling the streets of\nthe town, and we all had breakfast in a café. Bayonne is a nice town. It\nis like a very clean Spanish town and it is on a big river. Already, so\nearly in the morning, it was very hot on the bridge across the river. We\nwalked out on the bridge and then took a walk through the town.\n\nI was not at all sure Mike’s rods would come from Scotland in time, so\nwe hunted a tackle store and finally bought a rod for Bill up-stairs\nover a drygoods store. The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had\nto wait for him to come back. Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty\ngood rod cheap, and two landing-nets.\n\nWe went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral. Cohn\nmade some remark about it being a very good example of something or\nother, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim,\nlike Spanish churches. Then we went up past the old fort and out to the\nlocal Syndicat d’Initiative office, where the bus was supposed to start\nfrom. There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1st of\nJuly. We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a\nmotor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the\ncorner from the Municipal Theatre for four hundred francs. The car was\nto pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the café\non the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer. It was hot,\nbut the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant\nsitting in the café. A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that\nthe air came from the sea. There were pigeons out in the square, and the\nhouses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the\ncafé. But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the\nbill. We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went\nup to the hotel. It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with\nten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and\nwaited for Robert Cohn. While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the\nparquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. I pointed\nhim out to Bill and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just\ncome in from the garden. It was really an awfully clean hotel.\n\nCohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car. It was a big,\nclosed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs,\nand we had him put the back of the car down. He piled in the bags and we\nstarted off up the street and out of the town. We passed some lovely\ngardens and had a good look back at the town, and then we were out in\nthe country, green and rolling, and the road climbing all the time. We\npassed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the\nroad, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered. In the\nBasque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and\nvillages look well-off and clean. Every village had a pelota court and\non some of them kids were playing in the hot sun. There were signs on\nthe walls of the churches saying it was forbidden to play pelota against\nthem, and the houses in the villages had red tiled roofs, and then the\nroad turned off and commenced to climb and we were going way up close\nalong a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretched off back\ntoward the sea. You couldn’t see the sea. It was too far away. You could\nsee only hills and more hills, and you knew where the sea was."}
{"text": "We crossed the Spanish frontier. There was a little stream and a bridge,\nand Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats, and short\nguns on their backs, on one side, and on the other fat Frenchmen in\nkepis and mustaches. They only opened one bag and took the passports in\nand looked at them. There was a general store and inn on each side of\nthe line. The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the\ncar and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any\ntrout. Bill tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it\ndid not go very well. Robert Cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if\nthere were any trout in the stream, and the carabineer said yes, but not\nmany.\n\nI asked him if he ever fished, and he said no, that he didn’t care for\nit.\n\nJust then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes\nthat looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up\nto the bridge. He was carrying a long staff, and he had a kid slung on\nhis back, tied by the four legs, the head hanging down.\n\nThe carabineer waved him back with his sword. The man turned without\nsaying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain.\n\n“What’s the matter with the old one?” I asked.\n\n“He hasn’t got any passport.”\n\nI offered the guard a cigarette. He took it and thanked me.\n\n“What will he do?” I asked.\n\nThe guard spat in the dust.\n\n“Oh, he’ll just wade across the stream.”\n\n“Do you have much smuggling?”\n\n“Oh,” he said, “they go through.”\n\nThe chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the\ninside pocket of his coat. We all got in the car and it started up the\nwhite dusty road into Spain. For a while the country was much as it had\nbeen; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col, the road\nwinding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain. There\nwere long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of\nbeech-trees on some of the mountainsides. The road went along the summit\nof the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow\nup, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in\nthe road. We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest,\nand there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were\ngrassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went\nthrough a gloomy little village, and started to climb again. We climbed\nup and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road\nran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to\nthe south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes.\n\nAfter a while we came out of the mountains, and there were trees along\nboth sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the\nroad went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little\nrise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings\nclose around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and\nshifting in the wind. I was up in front with the driver and I turned\naround. Robert Cohn was asleep, but Bill looked and nodded his head.\nThen we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right\nshining in the sun from between the line of trees, and away off you\ncould see the plateau of Pamplona rising out of the plain, and the walls\nof the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of\nthe other churches. In back of the plateau were the mountains, and every\nway you looked there were other mountains, and ahead the road stretched\nout white across the plain going toward Pamplona.\n\nWe came into the town on the other side of the plateau, the road\nslanting up steeply and dustily with shade-trees on both sides, and then\nlevelling out through the new part of town they are building up outside\nthe old walls. We passed the bull-ring, high and white and\nconcrete-looking in the sun, and then came into the big square by a side\nstreet and stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya."}
{"text": "The driver helped us down with the bags. There was a crowd of kids\nwatching the car, and the square was hot, and the trees were green, and\nthe flags hung on their staffs, and it was good to get out of the sun\nand under the shade of the arcade that runs all the way around the\nsquare. Montoya was glad to see us, and shook hands and gave us good\nrooms looking out on the square, and then we washed and cleaned up and\nwent down-stairs in the dining-room for lunch. The driver stayed for\nlunch, too, and afterward we paid him and he started back to Bayonne.\n\nThere are two dining-rooms in the Montoya. One is up-stairs on the\nsecond floor and looks out on the square. The other is down one floor\nbelow the level of the square and has a door that opens on the back\nstreet that the bulls pass along when they run through the streets early\nin the morning on their way to the ring. It is always cool in the\ndown-stairs dining-room and we had a very good lunch. The first meal in\nSpain was always a shock with the hors d’œuvres, an egg course, two meat\ncourses, vegetables, salad, and dessert and fruit. You have to drink\nplenty of wine to get it all down. Robert Cohn tried to say he did not\nwant any of the second meat course, but we would not interpret for him,\nand so the waitress brought him something else as a replacement, a plate\nof cold meats, I think. Cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had\nmet at Bayonne. He did not know whether we knew Brett had been with him\nat San Sebastian, and it made him rather awkward.\n\n“Well,” I said, “Brett and Mike ought to get in to-night.”\n\n“I’m not sure they’ll come,” Cohn said.\n\n“Why not?” Bill said. “Of course they’ll come.”\n\n“They’re always late,” I said.\n\n“I rather think they’re not coming,” Robert Cohn said.\n\nHe said it with an air of superior knowledge that irritated both of us.\n\n“I’ll bet you fifty pesetas they’re here to-night,” Bill said. He always\nbets when he is angered, and so he usually bets foolishly.\n\n“I’ll take it,” Cohn said. “Good. You remember it, Jake. Fifty pesetas.”\n\n“I’ll remember it myself,” Bill said. I saw he was angry and wanted to\nsmooth him down.\n\n“It’s a sure thing they’ll come,” I said. “But maybe not to-night.”\n\n“Want to call it off?” Cohn asked.\n\n“No. Why should I? Make it a hundred if you like.”\n\n“All right. I’ll take that.”\n\n“That’s enough,” I said. “Or you’ll have to make a book and give me some\nof it.”\n\n“I’m satisfied,” Cohn said. He smiled. “You’ll probably win it back at\nbridge, anyway.”\n\n“You haven’t got it yet,” Bill said.\n\nWe went out to walk around under the arcade to the Café Iruña for\ncoffee. Cohn said he was going over and get a shave.\n\n“Say,” Bill said to me, “have I got any chance on that bet?”\n\n“You’ve got a rotten chance. They’ve never been on time anywhere. If\ntheir money doesn’t come it’s a cinch they won’t get in to-night.”\n\n“I was sorry as soon as I opened my mouth. But I had to call him. He’s\nall right, I guess, but where does he get this inside stuff? Mike and\nBrett fixed it up with us about coming down here.”\n\nI saw Cohn coming over across the square.\n\n“Here he comes.”\n\n“Well, let him not get superior and Jewish.”\n\n“The barber shop’s closed,” Cohn said. “It’s not open till four.”"}
{"text": "We had coffee at the Iruña, sitting in comfortable wicker chairs looking\nout from the cool of the arcade at the big square. After a while Bill\nwent to write some letters and Cohn went over to the barber-shop. It was\nstill closed, so he decided to go up to the hotel and get a bath, and I\nsat out in front of the café and then went for a walk in the town. It\nwas very hot, but I kept on the shady side of the streets and went\nthrough the market and had a good time seeing the town again. I went to\nthe Ayuntamiento and found the old gentleman who subscribes for the\nbull-fight tickets for me every year, and he had gotten the money I sent\nhim from Paris and renewed my subscriptions, so that was all set. He was\nthe archivist, and all the archives of the town were in his office. That\nhas nothing to do with the story. Anyway, his office had a green baize\ndoor and a big wooden door, and when I went out I left him sitting among\nthe archives that covered all the walls, and I shut both the doors, and\nas I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to\nbrush off my coat.\n\n“You must have been in a motor-car,” he said.\n\nThe back of the collar and the upper part of the shoulders were gray\nwith dust.\n\n“From Bayonne.”\n\n“Well, well,” he said. “I knew you were in a motor-car from the way the\ndust was.” So I gave him two copper coins.\n\nAt the end of the street I saw the cathedral and walked up toward it.\nThe first time I ever saw it I thought the façade was ugly but I liked\nit now. I went inside. It was dim and dark and the pillars went high up,\nand there were people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were\nsome wonderful big windows. I knelt and started to pray and prayed for\neverybody I thought of, Brett and Mike and Bill and Robert Cohn and\nmyself, and all the bull-fighters, separately for the ones I liked, and\nlumping all the rest, then I prayed for myself again, and while I was\npraying for myself I found I was getting sleepy, so I prayed that the\nbull-fights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta, and that\nwe would get some fishing. I wondered if there was anything else I might\npray for, and I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed\nthat I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I\nwould make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count,\nand I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn’t seen\nhim since that night in Montmartre, and about something funny Brett told\nme about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the\nwood in front of me, and was thinking of myself as praying, I was a\nlittle ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but\nrealized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while,\nand maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only\nwished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time; and then I was\nout in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers\nand the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in\nthe sun. The sunlight was hot and hard, and I crossed over beside some\nbuildings, and walked back along side-streets to the hotel.\n\nAt dinner that night we found that Robert Cohn had taken a bath, had had\na shave and a haircut and a shampoo, and something put on his hair\nafterward to make it stay down. He was nervous, and I did not try to\nhelp him any. The train was due in at nine o’clock from San Sebastian,\nand, if Brett and Mike were coming, they would be on it. At twenty\nminutes to nine we were not half through dinner. Robert Cohn got up from\nthe table and said he would go to the station. I said I would go with\nhim, just to devil him. Bill said he would be damned if he would leave\nhis dinner. I said we would be right back."}
{"text": "We walked to the station. I was enjoying Cohn’s nervousness. I hoped\nBrett would be on the train. At the station the train was late, and we\nsat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark. I have never seen\na man in civil life as nervous as Robert Cohn—nor as eager. I was\nenjoying it. It was lousy to enjoy it, but I felt lousy. Cohn had a\nwonderful quality of bringing out the worst in anybody.\n\nAfter a while we heard the train-whistle way off below on the other side\nof the plateau, and then we saw the headlight coming up the hill. We\nwent inside the station and stood with a crowd of people just back of\nthe gates, and the train came in and stopped, and everybody started\ncoming out through the gates.\n\nThey were not in the crowd. We waited till everybody had gone through\nand out of the station and gotten into buses, or taken cabs, or were\nwalking with their friends or relatives through the dark into the town.\n\n“I knew they wouldn’t come,” Robert said. We were going back to the\nhotel.\n\n“I thought they might,” I said.\n\nBill was eating fruit when we came in and finishing a bottle of wine.\n\n“Didn’t come, eh?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Do you mind if I give you that hundred pesetas in the morning, Cohn?”\nBill asked. “I haven’t changed any money here yet.”\n\n“Oh, forget about it,” Robert Cohn said. “Let’s bet on something else.\nCan you bet on bull-fights?”\n\n“You could,” Bill said, “but you don’t need to.”\n\n“It would be like betting on the war,” I said. “You don’t need any\neconomic interest.”\n\n“I’m very curious to see them,” Robert said.\n\nMontoya came up to our table. He had a telegram in his hand. “It’s for\nyou.” He handed it to me.\n\nIt read: “Stopped night San Sebastian.”\n\n“It’s from them,” I said. I put it in my pocket. Ordinarily I should\nhave handed it over.\n\n“They’ve stopped over in San Sebastian,” I said. “Send their regards to\nyou.”\n\nWhy I felt that impulse to devil him I do not know. Of course I do know.\nI was blind, unforgivingly jealous of what had happened to him. The fact\nthat I took it as a matter of course did not alter that any. I certainly\ndid hate him. I do not think I ever really hated him until he had that\nlittle spell of superiority at lunch—that and when he went through all\nthat barbering. So I put the telegram in my pocket. The telegram came to\nme, anyway.\n\n“Well,” I said. “We ought to pull out on the noon bus for Burguete. They\ncan follow us if they get in to-morrow night.”\n\nThere were only two trains up from San Sebastian, an early morning train\nand the one we had just met.\n\n“That sounds like a good idea,” Cohn said.\n\n“The sooner we get on the stream the better.”\n\n“It’s all one to me when we start,” Bill said. “The sooner the better.”\n\nWe sat in the Iruña for a while and had coffee and then took a little\nwalk out to the bull-ring and across the field and under the trees at\nthe edge of the cliff and looked down at the river in the dark, and I\nturned in early. Bill and Cohn stayed out in the café quite late, I\nbelieve, because I was asleep when they came in.\n\nIn the morning I bought three tickets for the bus to Burguete. It was\nscheduled to leave at two o’clock. There was nothing earlier. I was\nsitting over at the Iruña reading the papers when I saw Robert Cohn\ncoming across the square. He came up to the table and sat down in one of\nthe wicker chairs.\n\n“This is a comfortable café,” he said. “Did you have a good night,\nJake?”\n\n“I slept like a log.”\n\n“I didn’t sleep very well. Bill and I were out late, too.”\n\n“Where were you?”\n\n“Here. And after it shut we went over to that other café. The old man\nthere speaks German and English.”\n\n“The Café Suizo.”\n\n“That’s it. He seems like a nice old fellow. I think it’s a better café\nthan this one.”\n\n“It’s not so good in the daytime,” I said. “Too hot. By the way, I got\nthe bus tickets.”\n\n“I’m not going up to-day. You and Bill go on ahead.”\n\n“I’ve got your ticket.”\n\n“Give it to me. I’ll get the money back.”\n\n“It’s five pesetas.”\n\nRobert Cohn took out a silver five-peseta piece and gave it to me.\n\n“I ought to stay,” he said. “You see I’m afraid there’s some sort of\nmisunderstanding.”\n\n“Why,” I said. “They may not come here for three or four days now if\nthey start on parties at San Sebastian.”"}
{"text": "“That’s just it,” said Robert. “I’m afraid they expected to meet me at\nSan Sebastian, and that’s why they stopped over.”\n\n“What makes you think that?”\n\n“Well, I wrote suggesting it to Brett.”\n\n“Why in hell didn’t you stay there and meet them then?” I started to\nsay, but I stopped. I thought that idea would come to him by itself, but\nI do not believe it ever did.\n\nHe was being confidential now and it was giving him pleasure to be able\nto talk with the understanding that I knew there was something between\nhim and Brett.\n\n“Well, Bill and I will go up right after lunch,” I said.\n\n“I wish I could go. We’ve been looking forward to this fishing all\nwinter.” He was being sentimental about it. “But I ought to stay. I\nreally ought. As soon as they come I’ll bring them right up.”\n\n“Let’s find Bill.”\n\n“I want to go over to the barber-shop.”\n\n“See you at lunch.”\n\nI found Bill up in his room. He was shaving.\n\n“Oh, yes, he told me all about it last night,” Bill said. “He’s a great\nlittle confider. He said he had a date with Brett at San Sebastian.”\n\n“The lying bastard!”\n\n“Oh, no,” said Bill. “Don’t get sore. Don’t get sore at this stage of\nthe trip. How did you ever happen to know this fellow, anyway?”\n\n“Don’t rub it in.”\n\nBill looked around, half-shaved, and then went on talking into the\nmirror while he lathered his face.\n\n“Didn’t you send him with a letter to me in New York last winter? Thank\nGod, I’m a travelling man. Haven’t you got some more Jewish friends you\ncould bring along?” He rubbed his chin with his thumb, looked at it, and\nthen started scraping again.\n\n“You’ve got some fine ones yourself.”\n\n“Oh, yes. I’ve got some darbs. But not alongside of this Robert Cohn.\nThe funny thing is he’s nice, too. I like him. But he’s just so awful.”\n\n“He can be damn nice.”\n\n“I know it. That’s the terrible part.”\n\nI laughed.\n\n“Yes. Go on and laugh,” said Bill. “You weren’t out with him last night\nuntil two o’clock.”\n\n“Was he very bad?”\n\n“Awful. What’s all this about him and Brett, anyway? Did she ever have\nanything to do with him?”\n\nHe raised his chin up and pulled it from side to side.\n\n“Sure. She went down to San Sebastian with him.”\n\n“What a damn-fool thing to do. Why did she do that?”\n\n“She wanted to get out of town and she can’t go anywhere alone. She said\nshe thought it would be good for him.”\n\n“What bloody-fool things people do. Why didn’t she go off with some of\nher own people? Or you?”—he slurred that over—“or me? Why not me?” He\nlooked at his face carefully in the glass, put a big dab of lather on\neach cheek-bone. “It’s an honest face. It’s a face any woman would be\nsafe with.”\n\n“She’d never seen it.”\n\n“She should have. All women should see it. It’s a face that ought to be\nthrown on every screen in the country. Every woman ought to be given a\ncopy of this face as she leaves the altar. Mothers should tell their\ndaughters about this face. My son”—he pointed the razor at me—“go west\nwith this face and grow up with the country.”\n\nHe ducked down to the bowl, rinsed his face with cold water, put on some\nalcohol, and then looked at himself carefully in the glass, pulling down\nhis long upper lip.\n\n“My God!” he said, “isn’t it an awful face?”\n\nHe looked in the glass.\n\n“And as for this Robert Cohn,” Bill said, “he makes me sick, and he can\ngo to hell, and I’m damn glad he’s staying here so we won’t have him\nfishing with us.”\n\n“You’re damn right.”\n\n“We’re going trout-fishing. We’re going trout-fishing in the Irati\nRiver, and we’re going to get tight now at lunch on the wine of the\ncountry, and then take a swell bus ride.”\n\n“Come on. Let’s go over to the Iruña and start,” I said.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   11"}
{"text": "It was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our\nbags and the rod-case to go to Burguete. People were on top of the bus,\nand others were climbing up a ladder. Bill went up and Robert sat beside\nBill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a\ncouple of bottles of wine to take with us. When I came out the bus was\ncrowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top,\nand the women all had their fans going in the sun. It certainly was hot.\nRobert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one\nwooden seat that ran across the top.\n\nRobert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us start. A\nBasque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the\nbus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. He offered the\nwine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he\nimitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I\nspilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. He apologized and made\nme take another drink. He made the klaxon again a little later, and it\nfooled me the second time. He was very good at it. The Basques liked it.\nThe man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not\ngetting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. The man\nwaved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at\nlunch. When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long\ndrink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. Every one\ntook a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it\naway. They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They\nwere peasants going up into the hills.\n\nFinally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert\nCohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him. As\nsoon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt\nnice riding high up and close under the trees. The bus went quite fast\nand made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust\npowdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through\nthe trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. The\nBasque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the\nwine-bottle, and winked at us. He nodded his head.\n\n“Pretty nice, eh?”\n\n“These Basques are swell people,” Bill said.\n\nThe Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle-leather.\nHe wore a black smock like all the rest. There were wrinkles in his\ntanned neck. He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill. Bill\nhanded him one of our bottles. The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and\nhanded the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand.\nHe shoved the wine-bag up.\n\n“Arriba! Arriba!” he said. “Lift it up.”\n\nBill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into\nhis mouth, his head tipped back. When he stopped drinking and tipped the\nleather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin.\n\n“No! No!” several Basques said. “Not like that.” One snatched the bottle\naway from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. He\nwas a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms’ length and\nraised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream\nof wine hissed into his mouth. He held the bag out there, the wine\nmaking a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing\nsmoothly and regularly.\n\n“Hey!” the owner of the bottle shouted. “Whose wine is that?”\n\nThe drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his\neyes. Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the\nwine-bag and lowered it down to the owner. He winked at us. The owner\nshook the wine-skin sadly."}
{"text": "We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the\ndriver took on several packages. Then we started on again, and outside\nthe town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming\ncountry with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The\ngrain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a\nwind blowing the grain. The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose\nunder the wheels and hung in the air behind us. The road climbed up into\nthe hills and left the rich grain-fields below. Now there were only\npatches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the\nwater-courses. We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give\nroom to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the\nother, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. The wagon and\nthe mules were covered with dust. Close behind was another string of\nmules and another wagon. This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero\ndriving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we\npassed. Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky\nand hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain.\n\nWe came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a\nsudden green valley. A stream went through the centre of the town and\nfields of grapes touched the houses.\n\nThe bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got\ndown, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under\nthe big tarpaulins and lifted down. Bill and I got down and went into\nthe posada. There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and\nhay-forks made of white wood, and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes\nand hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging\nfrom the roof. It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long\nwooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks. Behind them were\nshelves stacked with supplies and goods.\n\nWe each had an aguardiente and paid forty centimes for the two drinks. I\ngave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the\ncopper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price.\n\nTwo of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink. So they\nbought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on\nthe back and bought another drink. Then we bought, and then we all went\nout into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus.\nThere was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the\nBasque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us. The woman\nwho had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and\ntalked to somebody inside the bus. Then the driver came out swinging two\nflat leather mail-pouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we\nstarted off.\n\nThe road left the green valley at once, and we were up in the hills\nagain. Bill and the wine-bottle Basque were having a conversation. A man\nleaned over from the other side of the seat and asked in English:\n“You’re Americans?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“I been there,” he said. “Forty years ago.”\n\nHe was an old man, as brown as the others, with the stubble of a white\nbeard.\n\n“How was it?”\n\n“What you say?”\n\n“How was America?”\n\n“Oh, I was in California. It was fine.”\n\n“Why did you leave?”\n\n“What you say?”\n\n“Why did you come back here?”\n\n“Oh! I come back to get married. I was going to go back but my wife she\ndon’t like to travel. Where you from?”\n\n“Kansas City.”\n\n“I been there,” he said. “I been in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City,\nDenver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City.”\n\nHe named them carefully.\n\n“How long were you over?”\n\n“Fifteen years. Then I come back and got married.”\n\n“Have a drink?”\n\n“All right,” he said. “You can’t get this in America, eh?”\n\n“There’s plenty if you can pay for it.”\n\n“What you come over here for?”\n\n“We’re going to the fiesta at Pamplona.”\n\n“You like the bull-fights?”\n\n“Sure. Don’t you?”\n\n“Yes,” he said. “I guess I like them.”\n\nThen after a little:\n\n“Where you go now?”\n\n“Up to Burguete to fish.”\n\n“Well,” he said, “I hope you catch something.”"}
{"text": "He shook hands and turned around to the back seat again. The other\nBasques had been impressed. He sat back comfortably and smiled at me\nwhen I turned around to look at the country. But the effort of talking\nAmerican seemed to have tired him. He did not say anything after that.\n\nThe bus climbed steadily up the road. The country was barren and rocks\nstuck up through the clay. There was no grass beside the road. Looking\nback we could see the country spread out below. Far back the fields were\nsquares of green and brown on the hillsides. Making the horizon were the\nbrown mountains. They were strangely shaped. As we climbed higher the\nhorizon kept changing. As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see\nother mountains coming up in the south. Then the road came over the\ncrest, flattened out, and went into a forest. It was a forest of cork\noaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were\ncattle grazing back in the trees. We went through the forest and the\nroad came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a\nrolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it. These were not like\nthe brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind. These were wooded\nand there were clouds coming down from them. The green plain stretched\noff. It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the\ntrunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the\nnorth. As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white\nhouses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain, and away off on the\nshoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of\nthe monastery of Roncesvalles.\n\n“There’s Roncevaux,” I said.\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Way off there where the mountain starts.”\n\n“It’s cold up here,” Bill said.\n\n“It’s high,” I said. “It must be twelve hundred metres.”\n\n“It’s awful cold,” Bill said.\n\nThe bus levelled down onto the straight line of road that ran to\nBurguete. We passed a crossroads and crossed a bridge over a stream. The\nhouses of Burguete were along both sides of the road. There were no\nside-streets. We passed the church and the school-yard, and the bus\nstopped. We got down and the driver handed down our bags and the\nrod-case. A carabineer in his cocked hat and yellow leather cross-straps\ncame up.\n\n“What’s in there?” he pointed to the rod-case.\n\nI opened it and showed him. He asked to see our fishing permits and I\ngot them out. He looked at the date and then waved us on.\n\n“Is that all right?” I asked.\n\n“Yes. Of course.”\n\nWe went up the street, past the whitewashed stone houses, families\nsitting in their doorways watching us, to the inn.\n\nThe fat woman who ran the inn came out from the kitchen and shook hands\nwith us. She took off her spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again.\nIt was cold in the inn and the wind was starting to blow outside. The\nwoman sent a girl up-stairs with us to show the room. There were two\nbeds, a washstand, a clothes-chest, and a big, framed steel-engraving of\nNuestra Señora de Roncesvalles. The wind was blowing against the\nshutters. The room was on the north side of the inn. We washed, put on\nsweaters, and came down-stairs into the dining-room. It had a stone\nfloor, low ceiling, and was oak-panelled. The shutters were up and it\nwas so cold you could see your breath.\n\n“My God!” said Bill. “It can’t be this cold to-morrow. I’m not going to\nwade a stream in this weather.”\n\nThere was an upright piano in the far corner of the room beyond the\nwooden tables and Bill went over and started to play.\n\n“I got to keep warm,” he said.\n\nI went out to find the woman and ask her how much the room and board\nwas. She put her hands under her apron and looked away from me.\n\n“Twelve pesetas.”\n\n“Why, we only paid that in Pamplona.”\n\nShe did not say anything, just took off her glasses and wiped them on\nher apron.\n\n“That’s too much,” I said. “We didn’t pay more than that at a big\nhotel.”\n\n“We’ve put in a bathroom.”\n\n“Haven’t you got anything cheaper?”\n\n“Not in the summer. Now is the big season.”\n\nWe were the only people in the inn. Well, I thought, it’s only a few\ndays.\n\n“Is the wine included?”\n\n“Oh, yes.”\n\n“Well,” I said. “It’s all right.”"}
{"text": "I went back to Bill. He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was,\nand went on playing. I sat at one of the tables and looked at the\npictures on the wall. There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of\npheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks. The panels were all\ndark and smoky-looking. There was a cupboard full of liqueur bottles. I\nlooked at them all. Bill was still playing. “How about a hot rum punch?”\nhe said. “This isn’t going to keep me warm permanently.”\n\nI went out and told the woman what a rum punch was and how to make it.\nIn a few minutes a girl brought a stone pitcher, steaming, into the\nroom. Bill came over from the piano and we drank the hot punch and\nlistened to the wind.\n\n“There isn’t too much rum in that.”\n\nI went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a\nhalf-tumblerful into the pitcher.\n\n“Direct action,” said Bill. “It beats legislation.”\n\nThe girl came in and laid the table for supper.\n\n“It blows like hell up here,” Bill said.\n\nThe girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine. We\nhad fried trout afterward and some sort of a stew and a big bowl full of\nwild strawberries. We did not lose money on the wine, and the girl was\nshy but nice about bringing it. The old woman looked in once and counted\nthe empty bottles.\n\nAfter supper we went up-stairs and smoked and read in bed to keep warm.\nOnce in the night I woke and heard the wind blowing. It felt good to be\nwarm and in bed.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   12\n\nWhen I woke in the morning I went to the window and looked out. It had\ncleared and there were no clouds on the mountains. Outside under the\nwindow were some carts and an old diligence, the wood of the roof\ncracked and split by the weather. It must have been left from the days\nbefore the motor-buses. A goat hopped up on one of the carts and then to\nthe roof of the diligence. He jerked his head at the other goats below\nand when I waved at him he bounded down.\n\nBill was still sleeping, so I dressed, put on my shoes outside in the\nhall, and went down-stairs. No one was stirring down-stairs, so I\nunbolted the door and went out. It was cool outside in the early morning\nand the sun had not yet dried the dew that had come when the wind died\ndown. I hunted around in the shed behind the inn and found a sort of\nmattock, and went down toward the stream to try and dig some worms for\nbait. The stream was clear and shallow but it did not look trouty. On\nthe grassy bank where it was damp I drove the mattock into the earth and\nloosened a chunk of sod. There were worms underneath. They slid out of\nsight as I lifted the sod and I dug carefully and got a good many.\nDigging at the edge of the damp ground I filled two empty tobacco-tins\nwith worms and sifted dirt onto them. The goats watched me dig.\n\nWhen I went back into the inn the woman was down in the kitchen, and I\nasked her to get coffee for us, and that we wanted a lunch. Bill was\nawake and sitting on the edge of the bed.\n\n“I saw you out of the window,” he said. “Didn’t want to interrupt you.\nWhat were you doing? Burying your money?”\n\n“You lazy bum!”\n\n“Been working for the common good? Splendid. I want you to do that every\nmorning.”\n\n“Come on,” I said. “Get up.”\n\n“What? Get up? I never get up.”\n\nHe climbed into bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin.\n\n“Try and argue me into getting up.”\n\nI went on looking for the tackle and putting it all together in the\ntackle-bag.\n\n“Aren’t you interested?” Bill asked.\n\n“I’m going down and eat.”\n\n“Eat? Why didn’t you say eat? I thought you just wanted me to get up for\nfun. Eat? Fine. Now you’re reasonable. You go out and dig some more\nworms and I’ll be right down.”\n\n“Oh, go to hell!”\n\n“Work for the good of all.” Bill stepped into his underclothes. “Show\nirony and pity.”\n\nI started out of the room with the tackle-bag, the nets, and the\nrod-case.\n\n“Hey! come back!”\n\nI put my head in the door.\n\n“Aren’t you going to show a little irony and pity?”\n\nI thumbed my nose.\n\n“That’s not irony.”"}
{"text": "As I went down-stairs I heard Bill singing, “Irony and Pity. When you’re\nfeeling . . . Oh, Give them Irony and Give them Pity. Oh, give them\nIrony. When they’re feeling . . . Just a little irony. Just a little\npity . . .” He kept on singing until he came down-stairs. The tune was:\n“The Bells are Ringing for Me and my Gal.” I was reading a week-old\nSpanish paper.\n\n“What’s all this irony and pity?”\n\n“What? Don’t you know about Irony and Pity?”\n\n“No. Who got it up?”\n\n“Everybody. They’re mad about it in New York. It’s just like the\nFratellinis used to be.”\n\nThe girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was\nbread toasted and buttered.\n\n“Ask her if she’s got any jam,” Bill said. “Be ironical with her.”\n\n“Have you got any jam?”\n\n“That’s not ironical. I wish I could talk Spanish.”\n\nThe coffee was good and we drank it out of big bowls. The girl brought\nin a glass dish of raspberry jam.\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“Hey! that’s not the way,” Bill said. “Say something ironical. Make some\ncrack about Primo de Rivera.”\n\n“I could ask her what kind of a jam they think they’ve gotten into in\nthe Riff.”\n\n“Poor,” said Bill. “Very poor. You can’t do it. That’s all. You don’t\nunderstand irony. You have no pity. Say something pitiful.”\n\n“Robert Cohn.”\n\n“Not so bad. That’s better. Now why is Cohn pitiful? Be ironic.”\n\nHe took a big gulp of coffee.\n\n“Aw, hell!” I said. “It’s too early in the morning.”\n\n“There you go. And you claim you want to be a writer, too. You’re only a\nnewspaper man. An expatriated newspaper man. You ought to be ironical\nthe minute you get out of bed. You ought to wake up with your mouth full\nof pity.”\n\n“Go on,” I said. “Who did you get this stuff from?”\n\n“Everybody. Don’t you read? Don’t you ever see anybody? You know what\nyou are? You’re an expatriate. Why don’t you live in New York? Then\nyou’d know these things. What do you want me to do? Come over here and\ntell you every year?”\n\n“Take some more coffee,” I said.\n\n“Good. Coffee is good for you. It’s the caffeine in it. Caffeine, we are\nhere. Caffeine puts a man on her horse and a woman in his grave. You\nknow what’s the trouble with you? You’re an expatriate. One of the worst\ntype. Haven’t you heard that? Nobody that ever left their own country\never wrote anything worth printing. Not even in the newspapers.”\n\nHe drank the coffee.\n\n“You’re an expatriate. You’ve lost touch with the soil. You get\nprecious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to\ndeath. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not\nworking. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafés.”\n\n“It sounds like a swell life,” I said. “When do I work?”\n\n“You don’t work. One group claims women support you. Another group\nclaims you’re impotent.”\n\n“No,” I said. “I just had an accident.”\n\n“Never mention that,” Bill said. “That’s the sort of thing that can’t be\nspoken of. That’s what you ought to work up into a mystery. Like Henry’s\nbicycle.”\n\nHe had been going splendidly, but he stopped. I was afraid he thought he\nhad hurt me with that crack about being impotent. I wanted to start him\nagain.\n\n“It wasn’t a bicycle,” I said. “He was riding horseback.”\n\n“I heard it was a tricycle.”\n\n“Well,” I said. “A plane is sort of like a tricycle. The joystick works\nthe same way.”\n\n“But you don’t pedal it.”\n\n“No,” I said, “I guess you don’t pedal it.”\n\n“Let’s lay off that,” Bill said.\n\n“All right. I was just standing up for the tricycle.”\n\n“I think he’s a good writer, too,” Bill said. “And you’re a hell of a\ngood guy. Anybody ever tell you you were a good guy?”\n\n“I’m not a good guy.”\n\n“Listen. You’re a hell of a good guy, and I’m fonder of you than anybody\non earth. I couldn’t tell you that in New York. It’d mean I was a\nfaggot. That was what the Civil War was about. Abraham Lincoln was a\nfaggot. He was in love with General Grant. So was Jefferson Davis.\nLincoln just freed the slaves on a bet. The Dred Scott case was framed\nby the Anti-Saloon League. Sex explains it all. The Colonel’s Lady and\nJudy O’Grady are Lesbians under their skin.”\n\nHe stopped.\n\n“Want to hear some more?”\n\n“Shoot,” I said.\n\n“I don’t know any more. Tell you some more at lunch.”\n\n“Old Bill,” I said.\n\n“You bum!”"}
{"text": "We packed the lunch and two bottles of wine in the rucksack, and Bill\nput it on. I carried the rod-case and the landing-nets slung over my\nback. We started up the road and then went across a meadow and found a\npath that crossed the fields and went toward the woods on the slope of\nthe first hill. We walked across the fields on the sandy path. The\nfields were rolling and grassy and the grass was short from the sheep\ngrazing. The cattle were up in the hills. We heard their bells in the\nwoods.\n\nThe path crossed a stream on a foot-log. The log was surfaced off, and\nthere was a sapling bent across for a rail. In the flat pool beside the\nstream tadpoles spotted the sand. We went up a steep bank and across the\nrolling fields. Looking back we saw Burguete, white houses and red\nroofs, and the white road with a truck going along it and the dust\nrising.\n\nBeyond the fields we crossed another faster-flowing stream. A sandy road\nled down to the ford and beyond into the woods. The path crossed the\nstream on another foot-log below the ford, and joined the road, and we\nwent into the woods.\n\nIt was a beech wood and the trees were very old. Their roots bulked\nabove the ground and the branches were twisted. We walked on the road\nbetween the thick trunks of the old beeches and the sunlight came\nthrough the leaves in light patches on the grass. The trees were big,\nand the foliage was thick but it was not gloomy. There was no\nundergrowth, only the smooth grass, very green and fresh, and the big\ngray trees well spaced as though it were a park.\n\n“This is country,” Bill said.\n\nThe road went up a hill and we got into thick woods, and the road kept\non climbing. Sometimes it dipped down but rose again steeply. All the\ntime we heard the cattle in the woods. Finally, the road came out on the\ntop of the hills. We were on the top of the height of land that was the\nhighest part of the range of wooded hills we had seen from Burguete.\nThere were wild strawberries growing on the sunny side of the ridge in a\nlittle clearing in the trees.\n\nAhead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the\nridge of hills. The hills ahead were not wooded, and there were great\nfields of yellow gorse. Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees\nand jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River.\n\n“We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go\nthrough the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley,”\nI pointed out to Bill.\n\n“That’s a hell of a hike.”\n\n“It’s too far to go and fish and come back the same day, comfortably.”\n\n“Comfortably. That’s a nice word. We’ll have to go like hell to get\nthere and back and have any fishing at all.”\n\nIt was a long walk and the country was very fine, but we were tired when\nwe came down the steep road that led out of the wooded hills into the\nvalley of the Rio de la Fabrica.\n\nThe road came out from the shadow of the woods into the hot sun. Ahead\nwas a river-valley. Beyond the river was a steep hill. There was a field\nof buckwheat on the hill. We saw a white house under some trees on the\nhillside. It was very hot and we stopped under some trees beside a dam\nthat crossed the river.\n\nBill put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods,\nput on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish.\n\n“You’re sure this thing has trout in it?” Bill asked.\n\n“It’s full of them.”\n\n“I’m going to fish a fly. You got any McGintys?”\n\n“There’s some in there.”\n\n“You going to fish bait?”\n\n“Yeah. I’m going to fish the dam here.”\n\n“Well, I’ll take the fly-book, then.” He tied on a fly. “Where’d I\nbetter go? Up or down?”\n\n“Down is the best. They’re plenty up above, too.”\n\nBill went down the bank.\n\n“Take a worm can.”\n\n“No, I don’t want one. If they won’t take a fly I’ll just flick it\naround.”\n\nBill was down below watching the stream.\n\n“Say,” he called up against the noise of the dam. “How about putting the\nwine in that spring up the road?”"}
{"text": "“All right,” I shouted. Bill waved his hand and started down the stream.\nI found the two wine-bottles in the pack, and carried them up the road\nto where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe. There was a\nboard over the spring and I lifted it and, knocking the corks firmly\ninto the bottles, lowered them down into the water. It was so cold my\nhand and wrist felt numbed. I put back the slab of wood, and hoped\nnobody would find the wine.\n\nI got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the bait-can and\nlanding-net, and walked out onto the dam. It was built to provide a head\nof water for driving logs. The gate was up, and I sat on one of the\nsquared timbers and watched the smooth apron of water before the river\ntumbled into the falls. In the white water at the foot of the dam it was\ndeep. As I baited up, a trout shot up out of the white water into the\nfalls and was carried down. Before I could finish baiting, another trout\njumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into\nthe water that was thundering down. I put on a good-sized sinker and\ndropped into the white water close to the edge of the timbers of the\ndam.\n\nI did not feel the first trout strike. When I started to pull up I felt\nthat I had one and brought him, fighting and bending the rod almost\ndouble, out of the boiling water at the foot of the falls, and swung him\nup and onto the dam. He was a good trout, and I banged his head against\nthe timber so that he quivered out straight, and then slipped him into\nmy bag.\n\nWhile I had him on, several trout had jumped at the falls. As soon as I\nbaited up and dropped in again I hooked another and brought him in the\nsame way. In a little while I had six. They were all about the same\nsize. I laid them out, side by side, all their heads pointing the same\nway, and looked at them. They were beautifully colored and firm and hard\nfrom the cold water. It was a hot day, so I slit them all and shucked\nout the insides, gills and all, and tossed them over across the river. I\ntook the trout ashore, washed them in the cold, smoothly heavy water\nabove the dam, and then picked some ferns and packed them all in the\nbag, three trout on a layer of ferns, then another layer of fems, then\nthree more trout, and then covered them with ferns. They looked nice in\nthe ferns, and now the bag was bulky, and I put it in the shade of the\ntree.\n\nIt was very hot on the dam, so I put my worm-can in the shade with the\nbag, and got a book out of the pack and settled down under the tree to\nread until Bill should come up for lunch.\n\nIt was a little past noon and there was not much shade, but I sat\nagainst the trunk of two of the trees that grew together, and read. The\nbook was something by A. E. W. Mason, and I was reading a wonderful\nstory about a man who had been frozen in the Alps and then fallen into a\nglacier and disappeared, and his bride was going to wait twenty-four\nyears exactly for his body to come out on the moraine, while her true\nlove waited too, and they were still waiting when Bill came up.\n\n“Get any?” he asked. He had his rod and his bag and his net all in one\nhand, and he was sweating. I hadn’t heard him come up, because of the\nnoise from the dam.\n\n“Six. What did you get?”\n\nBill sat down, opened up his bag, laid a big trout on the grass. He took\nout three more, each one a little bigger than the last, and laid them\nside by side in the shade from the tree. His face was sweaty and happy.\n\n“How are yours?”\n\n“Smaller.”\n\n“Let’s see them.”\n\n“They’re packed.”\n\n“How big are they really?”\n\n“They’re all about the size of your smallest.”\n\n“You’re not holding out on me?”\n\n“I wish I were.”\n\n“Get them all on worms?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You lazy bum!”\n\nBill put the trout in the bag and started for the river, swinging the\nopen bag. He was wet from the waist down and I knew he must have been\nwading the stream.\n\nI walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine. They were\ncold. Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back to the trees. I\nspread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked one of the bottles and\nleaned the other against a tree. Bill came up drying his hands, his bag\nplump with ferns."}
{"text": "“Let’s see that bottle,” he said. He pulled the cork, and tipped up the\nbottle and drank. “Whew! That makes my eyes ache.”\n\n“Let’s try it.”\n\nThe wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty.\n\n“That’s not such filthy wine,” Bill said.\n\n“The cold helps it,” I said.\n\nWe unwrapped the little parcels of lunch.\n\n“Chicken.”\n\n“There’s hard-boiled eggs.”\n\n“Find any salt?”\n\n“First the egg,” said Bill. “Then the chicken. Even Bryan could see\nthat.”\n\n“He’s dead. I read it in the paper yesterday.”\n\n“No. Not really?”\n\n“Yes. Bryan’s dead.”\n\nBill laid down the egg he was peeling.\n\n“Gentlemen,” he said, and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of\nnewspaper. “I reverse the order. For Bryan’s sake. As a tribute to the\nGreat Commoner. First the chicken; then the egg.”\n\n“Wonder what day God created the chicken?”\n\n“Oh,” said Bill, sucking the drumstick, “how should we know? We should\nnot question. Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and\nbelieve and give thanks.”\n\n“Eat an egg.”\n\nBill gestured with the drumstick in one hand and the bottle of wine in\nthe other.\n\n“Let us rejoice in our blessings. Let us utilize the fowls of the air.\nLet us utilize the product of the vine. Will you utilize a little,\nbrother?”\n\n“After you, brother.”\n\nBill took a long drink.\n\n“Utilize a little, brother,” he handed me the bottle. “Let us not doubt,\nbrother. Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hen-coop with\nsimian fingers. Let us accept on faith and simply say—I want you to\njoin with me in saying—What shall we say, brother?” He pointed the\ndrumstick at me and went on. “Let me tell you. We will say, and I for\none am proud to say—and I want you to say with me, on your knees,\nbrother. Let no man be ashamed to kneel here in the great out-of-doors.\nRemember the woods were God’s first temples. Let us kneel and say:\n‘Don’t eat that, Lady—that’s Mencken.’”\n\n“Here,” I said. “Utilize a little of this.”\n\nWe uncorked the other bottle.\n\n“What’s the matter?” I said. “Didn’t you like Bryan?”\n\n“I loved Bryan,” said Bill. “We were like brothers.”\n\n“Where did you know him?”\n\n“He and Mencken and I all went to Holy Cross together.”\n\n“And Frankie Fritsch.”\n\n“It’s a lie. Frankie Fritsch went to Fordham.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning.”\n\n“It’s a lie,” Bill said. “I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning myself.”\n\n“You’re cock-eyed,” I said.\n\n“On wine?”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“It’s the humidity,” Bill said. “They ought to take this damn humidity\naway.”\n\n“Have another shot.”\n\n“Is this all we’ve got?”\n\n“Only the two bottles.”\n\n“Do you know what you are?” Bill looked at the bottle affectionately.\n\n“No,” I said.\n\n“You’re in the pay of the Anti-Saloon League.”\n\n“I went to Notre Dame with Wayne B. Wheeler.”\n\n“It’s a lie,” said Bill. “I went to Austin Business College with Wayne\nB. Wheeler. He was class president.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “the saloon must go.”\n\n“You’re right there, old classmate,” Bill said. “The saloon must go, and\nI will take it with me.”\n\n“You’re cock-eyed.”\n\n“On wine?”\n\n“On wine.”\n\n“Well, maybe I am.”\n\n“Want to take a nap?”\n\n“All right.”\n\nWe lay with our heads in the shade and looked up into the trees.\n\n“You asleep?”\n\n“No,” Bill said. “I was thinking.”\n\nI shut my eyes. It felt good lying on the ground.\n\n“Say,” Bill said, “what about this Brett business?”\n\n“What about it?”\n\n“Were you ever in love with her?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“For how long?”\n\n“Off and on for a hell of a long time.”\n\n“Oh, hell!” Bill said. “I’m sorry, fella.”\n\n“It’s all right,” I said. “I don’t give a damn any more.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Really. Only I’d a hell of a lot rather not talk about it.”\n\n“You aren’t sore I asked you?”\n\n“Why the hell should I be?”\n\n“I’m going to sleep,” Bill said. He put a newspaper over his face.\n\n“Listen, Jake,” he said, “are you really a Catholic?”\n\n“Technically.”\n\n“What does that mean?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“All right, I’ll go to sleep now,” he said. “Don’t keep me awake by\ntalking so much.”\n\nI went to sleep, too. When I woke up Bill was packing the rucksack. It\nwas late in the afternoon and the shadow from the trees was long and\nwent out over the dam. I was stiff from sleeping on the ground.\n\n“What did you do? Wake up?” Bill asked. “Why didn’t you spend the\nnight?” I stretched and rubbed my eyes.\n\n“I had a lovely dream,” Bill said. “I don’t remember what it was about,\nbut it was a lovely dream.”\n\n“I don’t think I dreamt.”"}
{"text": "“You ought to dream,” Bill said. “All our biggest business men have been\ndreamers. Look at Ford. Look at President Coolidge. Look at Rockefeller.\nLook at Jo Davidson.”\n\nI disjointed my rod and Bill’s and packed them in the rod-case. I put\nthe reels in the tackle-bag. Bill had packed the rucksack and we put one\nof the trout-bags in. I carried the other.\n\n“Well,” said Bill, “have we got everything?”\n\n“The worms.”\n\n“Your worms. Put them in there.”\n\nHe had the pack on his back and I put the worm-cans in one of the\noutside flap pockets.\n\n“You got everything now?”\n\nI looked around on the grass at the foot of the elm-trees.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWe started up the road into the woods. It was a long walk home to\nBurguete, and it was dark when we came down across the fields to the\nroad, and along the road between the houses of the town, their windows\nlighted, to the inn.\n\nWe stayed five days at Burguete and had good fishing. The nights were\ncold and the days were hot, and there was always a breeze even in the\nheat of the day. It was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a\ncold stream, and the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the\nbank. We found a stream with a pool deep enough to swim in. In the\nevenings we played three-handed bridge with an Englishman named Harris,\nwho had walked over from Saint Jean Pied de Port and was stopping at the\ninn for the fishing. He was very pleasant and went with us twice to the\nIrati River. There was no word from Robert Cohn nor from Brett and Mike.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   13\n\nOne morning I went down to breakfast and the Englishman, Harris, was\nalready at the table. He was reading the paper through spectacles. He\nlooked up and smiled.\n\n“Good morning,” he said. “Letter for you. I stopped at the post and they\ngave it me with mine.”\n\nThe letter was at my place at the table, leaning against a coffee-cup.\nHarris was reading the paper again. I opened the letter. It had been\nforwarded from Pamplona. It was dated San Sebastian, Sunday:\n\nWe got here Friday, Brett passed out on the train, so brought\n    her here for 3 days rest with old friends of ours. We go to\n    Montoya Hotel Pamplona Tuesday, arriving at I don’t know what\n    hour. Will you send a note by the bus to tell us what to do to\n    rejoin you all on Wednesday. All our love and sorry to be late,\n    but Brett was really done in and will be quite all right by\n    Tues. and is practically so now. I know her so well and try to\n    look after her but it’s not so easy. Love to all the chaps,\n\nMICHAEL.\n\n“What day of the week is it?” I asked Harris.\n\n“Wednesday, I think. Yes, quite. Wednesday. Wonderful how one loses\ntrack of the days up here in the mountains.”\n\n“Yes. We’ve been here nearly a week.”\n\n“I hope you’re not thinking of leaving?”\n\n“Yes. We’ll go in on the afternoon bus, I’m afraid.”\n\n“What a rotten business. I had hoped we’d all have another go at the\nIrati together.”\n\n“We have to go _into_ Pamplona. We’re meeting people there.”\n\n“What rotten luck for me. We’ve had a jolly time here at Burguete.”\n\n“Come on in to Pamplona. We can play some bridge there, and there’s\ngoing to be a damned fine fiesta.”\n\n“I’d like to. Awfully nice of you to ask me. I’d best stop on here,\nthough. I’ve not much more time to fish.”\n\n“You want those big ones in the Irati.”\n\n“I say, I do, you know. They’re enormous trout there.”\n\n“I’d like to try them once more.”\n\n“Do. Stop over another day. Be a good chap.”\n\n“We really have to get into town,” I said.\n\n“What a pity.”\n\nAfter breakfast Bill and I were sitting warming in the sun on a bench\nout in front of the inn and talking it over. I saw a girl coming up the\nroad from the centre of the town. She stopped in front of us and took a\ntelegram out of the leather wallet that hung against her skirt.\n\n“Por ustedes?”\n\nI looked at it. The address was: “Barnes, Burguete.”\n\n“Yes. It’s for us.”\n\nShe brought out a book for me to sign, and I gave her a couple of\ncoppers. The telegram was in Spanish: “Vengo Jueves Cohn.”\n\nI handed it to Bill.\n\n“What does the word Cohn mean?” he asked.\n\n“What a lousy telegram!” I said. “He could send ten words for the same\nprice. ‘I come Thursday.’ That gives you a lot of dope, doesn’t it?”"}
{"text": "“It gives you all the dope that’s of interest to Cohn.”\n\n“We’re going in, anyway,” I said. “There’s no use trying to move Brett\nand Mike out here and back before the fiesta. Should we answer it?”\n\n“We might as well,” said Bill. “There’s no need for us to be snooty.”\n\nWe walked up to the post-office and asked for a telegraph blank.\n\n“What will we say?” Bill asked.\n\n“‘Arriving to-night.’ That’s enough.”\n\nWe paid for the message and walked back to the inn. Harris was there and\nthe three of us walked up to Roncesvalles. We went through the\nmonastery.\n\n“It’s a remarkable place,” Harris said, when we came out. “But you know\nI’m not much on those sort of places.”\n\n“Me either,” Bill said.\n\n“It’s a remarkable place, though,” Harris said. “I wouldn’t not have\nseen it. I’d been intending coming up each day.”\n\n“It isn’t the same as fishing, though, is it?” Bill asked. He liked\nHarris.\n\n“I say not.”\n\nWe were standing in front of the old chapel of the monastery.\n\n“Isn’t that a pub across the way?” Harris asked. “Or do my eyes deceive\nme?”\n\n“It has the look of a pub,” Bill said.\n\n“It looks to me like a pub,” I said.\n\n“I say,” said Harris, “let’s utilize it.” He had taken up utilizing from\nBill.\n\nWe had a bottle of wine apiece. Harris would not let us pay. He talked\nSpanish quite well, and the innkeeper would not take our money.\n\n“I say. You don’t know what it’s meant to me to have you chaps up here.”\n\n“We’ve had a grand time, Harris.”\n\nHarris was a little tight.\n\n“I say. Really you don’t know how much it means. I’ve not had much fun\nsince the war.”\n\n“We’ll fish together again, some time. Don’t you forget it, Harris.”\n\n“We must. We _have_ had such a jolly good time.”\n\n“How about another bottle around?”\n\n“Jolly good idea,” said Harris.\n\n“This is mine,” said Bill. “Or we don’t drink it.”\n\n“I wish you’d let me pay for it. It _does_ give me pleasure, you know.”\n\n“This is going to give me pleasure,” Bill said.\n\nThe innkeeper brought in the fourth bottle. We had kept the same\nglasses. Harris lifted his glass.\n\n“I say. You know this does utilize well.”\n\nBill slapped him on the back.\n\n“Good old Harris.”\n\n“I say. You know my name isn’t really Harris. It’s Wilson-Harris. All\none name. With a hyphen, you know.”\n\n“Good old Wilson-Harris,” Bill said. “We call you Harris because we’re\nso fond of you.”\n\n“I say, Barnes. You don’t know what this all means to me.”\n\n“Come on and utilize another glass,” I said.\n\n“Barnes. Really, Barnes, you can’t know. That’s all.”\n\n“Drink up, Harris.”\n\nWe walked back down the road from Roncesvalles with Harris between us.\nWe had lunch at the inn and Harris went with us to the bus. He gave us\nhis card, with his address in London and his club and his business\naddress, and as we got on the bus he handed us each an envelope. I\nopened mine and there were a dozen flies in it. Harris had tied them\nhimself. He tied all his own flies.\n\n“I say, Harris—” I began.\n\n“No, no!” he said. He was climbing down from the bus. “They’re not\nfirst-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it\nmight remind you of what a good time we had.”\n\nThe bus started. Harris stood in front of the post-office. He waved. As\nwe started along the road he turned and walked back toward the inn.\n\n“Say, wasn’t that Harris nice?” Bill said.\n\n“I think he really did have a good time.”\n\n“Harris? You bet he did.”\n\n“I wish he’d come into Pamplona.”\n\n“He wanted to fish.”\n\n“Yes. You couldn’t tell how English would mix with each other, anyway.”\n\n“I suppose not.”\n\nWe got into Pamplona late in the afternoon and the bus stopped in front\nof the Hotel Montoya. Out in the plaza they were stringing\nelectric-light wires to light the plaza for the fiesta. A few kids came\nup when the bus stopped, and a customs officer for the town made all the\npeople getting down from the bus open their bundles on the sidewalk. We\nwent into the hotel and on the stairs I met Montoya. He shook hands with\nus, smiling in his embarrassed way.\n\n“Your friends are here,” he said.\n\n“Mr. Campbell?”\n\n“Yes. Mr. Cohn and Mr. Campbell and Lady Ashley.”\n\nHe smiled as though there were something I would hear about.\n\n“When did they get in?”\n\n“Yesterday. I’ve saved you the rooms you had.”\n\n“That’s fine. Did you give Mr. Campbell the room on the plaza?”\n\n“Yes. All the rooms we looked at.”"}
{"text": "“Where are our friends now?”\n\n“I think they went to the pelota.”\n\n“And how about the bulls?”\n\nMontoya smiled. “To-night,” he said. “To-night at seven o’clock they\nbring in the Villar bulls, and to-morrow come the Miuras. Do you all go\ndown?”\n\n“Oh, yes. They’ve never seen a desencajonada.”\n\nMontoya put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n“I’ll see you there.”\n\nHe smiled again. He always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very\nspecial secret between the two of us; a rather shocking but really very\ndeep secret that we knew about. He always smiled as though there were\nsomething lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something\nthat we understood. It would not do to expose it to people who would not\nunderstand.\n\n“Your friend, is he aficionado, too?” Montoya smiled at Bill.\n\n“Yes. He came all the way from New York to see the San Fermines.”\n\n“Yes?” Montoya politely disbelieved. “But he’s not aficionado like you.”\n\nHe put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly.\n\n“Yes,” I said. “He’s a real aficionado.”\n\n“But he’s not aficionado like you are.”\n\nAficion means passion. An aficionado is one who is passionate about the\nbull-fights. All the good bull-fighters stayed at Montoya’s hotel; that\nis, those with aficion stayed there. The commercial bull-fighters stayed\nonce, perhaps, and then did not come back. The good ones came each year.\nIn Montoya’s room were their photographs. The photographs were dedicated\nto Juanito Montoya or to his sister. The photographs of bull-fighters\nMontoya had really believed in were framed. Photographs of bull-fighters\nwho had been without aficion Montoya kept in a drawer of his desk. They\noften had the most flattering inscriptions. But they did not mean\nanything. One day Montoya took them all out and dropped them in the\nwaste-basket. He did not want them around.\n\nWe often talked about bulls and bull-fighters. I had stopped at the\nMontoya for several years. We never talked for very long at a time. It\nwas simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt. Men would come\nin from distant towns and before they left Pamplona stop and talk for a\nfew minutes with Montoya about bulls. These men were aficionados. Those\nwho were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was\nfull. Montoya introduced me to some of them. They were always very\npolite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an\nAmerican. Somehow it was taken for granted that an American could not\nhave aficion. He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he\ncould not really have it. When they saw that I had aficion, and there\nwas no password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was\na sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions always a little\non the defensive and never apparent, there was this same embarrassed\nputting the hand on the shoulder, or a “Buen hombre.” But nearly always\nthere was the actual touching. It seemed as though they wanted to touch\nyou to make it certain.\n\nMontoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion. He\ncould forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all\nsorts of lapses. For one who had aficion he could forgive anything. At\nonce he forgave me all my friends. Without his ever saying anything they\nwere simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling\nopen of the horses in bull-fighting.\n\nBill had gone up-stairs as we came in, and I found him washing and\nchanging in his room.\n\n“Well,” he said, “talk a lot of Spanish?”\n\n“He was telling me about the bulls coming in to-night.”\n\n“Let’s find the gang and go down.”\n\n“All right. They’ll probably be at the café.”\n\n“Have you got tickets?”\n\n“Yes. I got them for all the unloadings.”\n\n“What’s it like?” He was pulling his cheek before the glass, looking to\nsee if there were unshaved patches under the line of the jaw.\n\n“It’s pretty good,” I said. “They let the bulls out of the cages one at\na time, and they have steers in the corral to receive them and keep them\nfrom fighting, and the bulls tear in at the steers and the steers run\naround like old maids trying to quiet them down.”\n\n“Do they ever gore the steers?”"}
{"text": "“Sure. Sometimes they go right after them and kill them.”\n\n“Can’t the steers do anything?”\n\n“No. They’re trying to make friends.”\n\n“What do they have them in for?”\n\n“To quiet down the bulls and keep them from breaking horns against the\nstone walls, or goring each other.”\n\n“Must be swell being a steer.”\n\nWe went down the stairs and out of the door and walked across the square\ntoward the Café Iruña. There were two lonely looking ticket-houses\nstanding in the square. Their windows, marked SOL, SOL Y SOMBRA, and\nSOMBRA, were shut. They would not open until the day before the fiesta.\n\nAcross the square the white wicker tables and chairs of the Iruña\nextended out beyond the Arcade to the edge of the street. I looked for\nBrett and Mike at the tables. There they were. Brett and Mike and Robert\nCohn. Brett was wearing a Basque beret. So was Mike. Robert Cohn was\nbare-headed and wearing his spectacles. Brett saw us coming and waved.\nHer eyes crinkled up as we came up to the table.\n\n“Hello, you chaps!” she called.\n\nBrett was happy. Mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into\nshaking hands. Robert Cohn shook hands because we were back.\n\n“Where the hell have you been?” I asked.\n\n“I brought them up here,” Cohn said.\n\n“What rot,” Brett said. “We’d have gotten here earlier if you hadn’t\ncome.”\n\n“You’d never have gotten here.”\n\n“What rot! You chaps are brown. Look at Bill.”\n\n“Did you get good fishing?” Mike asked. “We wanted to join you.”\n\n“It wasn’t bad. We missed you.”\n\n“I wanted to come,” Cohn said, “but I thought I ought to bring them.”\n\n“You bring us. What rot.”\n\n“Was it really good?” Mike asked. “Did you take many?”\n\n“Some days we took a dozen apiece. There was an Englishman up there.”\n\n“Named Harris,” Bill said. “Ever know him, Mike? He was in the war,\ntoo.”\n\n“Fortunate fellow,” Mike said. “What times we had. How I wish those dear\ndays were back.”\n\n“Don’t be an ass.”\n\n“Were you in the war, Mike?” Cohn asked.\n\n“Was I not.”\n\n“He was a very distinguished soldier,” Brett said. “Tell them about the\ntime your horse bolted down Piccadilly.”\n\n“I’ll not. I’ve told that four times.”\n\n“You never told me,” Robert Cohn said.\n\n“I’ll not tell that story. It reflects discredit on me.”\n\n“Tell them about your medals.”\n\n“I’ll not. That story reflects great discredit on me.”\n\n“What story’s that?”\n\n“Brett will tell you. She tells all the stories that reflect discredit\non me.”\n\n“Go on. Tell it, Brett.”\n\n“Should I?”\n\n“I’ll tell it myself.”\n\n“What medals have you got, Mike?”\n\n“I haven’t got any medals.”\n\n“You must have some.”\n\n“I suppose I’ve the usual medals. But I never sent in for them. One time\nthere was this wopping big dinner and the Prince of Wales was to be\nthere, and the cards said medals will be worn. So naturally I had no\nmedals, and I stopped at my tailor’s and he was impressed by the\ninvitation, and I thought that’s a good piece of business, and I said to\nhim: ‘You’ve got to fix me up with some medals.’ He said: ‘What medals,\nsir?’ And I said: ‘Oh, any medals. Just give me a few medals.’ So he\nsaid: ‘What medals _have_ you, sir?’ And I said: ‘How should I know?’\nDid he think I spent all my time reading the bloody gazette? ‘Just give\nme a good lot. Pick them out yourself.’ So he got me some medals, you\nknow, miniature medals, and handed me the box, and I put it in my pocket\nand forgot it. Well, I went to the dinner, and it was the night they’d\nshot Henry Wilson, so the Prince didn’t come and the King didn’t come,\nand no one wore any medals, and all these coves were busy taking off\ntheir medals, and I had mine in my pocket.”\n\nHe stopped for us to laugh.\n\n“Is that all?”\n\n“That’s all. Perhaps I didn’t tell it right.”\n\n“You didn’t,” said Brett. “But no matter.”\n\nWe were all laughing.\n\n“Ah, yes,” said Mike. “I know now. It was a damn dull dinner, and I\ncouldn’t stick it, so I left. Later on in the evening I found the box in\nmy pocket. What’s this? I said. Medals? Bloody military medals? So I cut\nthem all off their backing—you know, they put them on a strip—and gave\nthem all around. Gave one to each girl. Form of souvenir. They thought I\nwas hell’s own shakes of a soldier. Give away medals in a night club.\nDashing fellow.”\n\n“Tell the rest,” Brett said."}
{"text": "“Don’t you think that was funny?” Mike asked. We were all laughing. “It\nwas. I swear it was. Any rate, my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals\nback. Sent a man around. Kept on writing for months. Seems some chap had\nleft them to be cleaned. Frightfully military cove. Set hell’s own store\nby them.” Mike paused. “Rotten luck for the tailor,” he said.\n\n“You don’t mean it,” Bill said. “I should think it would have been grand\nfor the tailor.”\n\n“Frightfully good tailor. Never believe it to see me now,” Mike said. “I\nused to pay him a hundred pounds a year just to keep him quiet. So he\nwouldn’t send me any bills. Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt.\nIt was right after the medals. Gave his letters rather a bitter tone.”\n\n“How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked.\n\n“Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.”\n\n“What brought it on?”\n\n“Friends,” said Mike. “I had a lot of friends. False friends. Then I had\ncreditors, too. Probably had more creditors than anybody in England.”\n\n“Tell them about in the court,” Brett said.\n\n“I don’t remember,” Mike said. “I was just a little tight.”\n\n“Tight!” Brett exclaimed. “You were blind!”\n\n“Extraordinary thing,” Mike said. “Met my former partner the other day.\nOffered to buy me a drink.”\n\n“Tell them about your learned counsel,” Brett said.\n\n“I will not,” Mike said. “My learned counsel was blind, too. I say this\nis a gloomy subject. Are we going down and see these bulls unloaded or\nnot?”\n\n“Let’s go down.”\n\nWe called the waiter, paid, and started to walk through the town. I\nstarted off walking with Brett, but Robert Cohn came up and joined her\non the other side. The three of us walked along, past the Ayuntamiento\nwith the banners hung from the balcony, down past the market and down\npast the steep street that led to the bridge across the Arga. There were\nmany people walking to go and see the bulls, and carriages drove down\nthe hill and across the bridge, the drivers, the horses, and the whips\nrising above the walking people in the street. Across the bridge we\nturned up a road to the corrals. We passed a wine-shop with a sign in\nthe window: Good Wine 30 Centimes A Liter.\n\n“That’s where we’ll go when funds get low,” Brett said.\n\nThe woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we\npassed. She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the\nwindow and stared. They were staring at Brett.\n\nAt the gate of the corrals two men took tickets from the people that\nwent in. We went in through the gate. There were trees inside and a low,\nstone house. At the far end was the stone wall of the corrals, with\napertures in the stone that were like loopholes running all along the\nface of each corral. A ladder led up to the top of the wall, and people\nwere climbing up the ladder and spreading down to stand on the walls\nthat separated the two corrals. As we came up the ladder, walking across\nthe grass under the trees, we passed the big, gray painted cages with\nthe bulls in them. There was one bull in each travelling-box. They had\ncome by train from a bull-breeding ranch in Castile, and had been\nunloaded off flat-cars at the station and brought up here to be let out\nof their cages into the corrals. Each cage was stencilled with the name\nand the brand of the bull-breeder.\n\nWe climbed up and found a place on the wall looking down into the\ncorral. The stone walls were whitewashed, and there was straw on the\nground and wooden feed-boxes and water-troughs set against the wall.\n\n“Look up there,” I said.\n\nBeyond the river rose the plateau of the town. All along the old walls\nand ramparts people were standing. The three lines of fortifications\nmade three black lines of people. Above the walls there were heads in\nthe windows of the houses. At the far end of the plateau boys had\nclimbed into the trees.\n\n“They must think something is going to happen,” Brett said.\n\n“They want to see the bulls.”\n\nMike and Bill were on the other wall across the pit of the corral. They\nwaved to us. People who had come late were standing behind us, pressing\nagainst us when other people crowded them.\n\n“Why don’t they start?” Robert Cohn asked."}
{"text": "A single mule was hitched to one of the cages and dragged it up against\nthe gate in the corral wall. The men shoved and lifted it with crowbars\ninto position against the gate. Men were standing on the wall ready to\npull up the gate of the corral and then the gate of the cage. At the\nother end of the corral a gate opened and two steers came in, swaying\ntheir heads and trotting, their lean flanks swinging. They stood\ntogether at the far end, their heads toward the gate where the bull\nwould enter.\n\n“They don’t look happy,” Brett said.\n\nThe men on top of the wall leaned back and pulled up the door of the\ncorral. Then they pulled up the door of the cage.\n\nI leaned way over the wall and tried to see into the cage. It was dark.\nSome one rapped on the cage with an iron bar. Inside something seemed to\nexplode. The bull, striking into the wood from side to side with his\nhorns, made a great noise. Then I saw a dark muzzle and the shadow of\nhorns, and then, with a clattering on the wood in the hollow box, the\nbull charged and came out into the corral, skidding with his forefeet in\nthe straw as he stopped, his head up, the great hump of muscle on his\nneck swollen tight, his body muscles quivering as he looked up at the\ncrowd on the stone walls. The two steers backed away against the wall,\ntheir heads sunken, their eyes watching the bull.\n\nThe bull saw them and charged. A man shouted from behind one of the\nboxes and slapped his hat against the planks, and the bull, before he\nreached the steer, turned, gathered himself and charged where the man\nhad been, trying to reach him behind the planks with a half-dozen quick,\nsearching drives with the right horn.\n\n“My God, isn’t he beautiful?” Brett said. We were looking right down on\nhim.\n\n“Look how he knows how to use his horns,” I said. “He’s got a left and a\nright just like a boxer.”\n\n“Not really?”\n\n“You watch.”\n\n“It goes too fast.”\n\n“Wait. There’ll be another one in a minute.”\n\nThey had backed up another cage into the entrance. In the far corner a\nman, from behind one of the plank shelters, attracted the bull, and\nwhile the bull was facing away the gate was pulled up and a second bull\ncame out into the corral.\n\nHe charged straight for the steers and two men ran out from behind the\nplanks and shouted, to turn him. He did not change his direction and the\nmen shouted: “Hah! Hah! Toro!” and waved their arms; the two steers\nturned sideways to take the shock, and the bull drove into one of the\nsteers.\n\n“Don’t look,” I said to Brett. She was watching, fascinated.\n\n“Fine,” I said. “If it doesn’t buck you.”\n\n“I saw it,” she said. “I saw him shift from his left to his right horn.”\n\n“Damn good!”\n\nThe steer was down now, his neck stretched out, his head twisted, he lay\nthe way he had fallen. Suddenly the bull left off and made for the other\nsteer which had been standing at the far end, his head swinging,\nwatching it all. The steer ran awkwardly and the bull caught him, hooked\nhim lightly in the flank, and then turned away and looked up at the\ncrowd on the walls, his crest of muscle rising. The steer came up to him\nand made as though to nose at him and the bull hooked perfunctorily. The\nnext time he nosed at the steer and then the two of them trotted over to\nthe other bull.\n\nWhen the next bull came out, all three, the two bulls and the steer,\nstood together, their heads side by side, their horns against the\nnewcomer. In a few minutes the steer picked the new bull up, quieted him\ndown, and made him one of the herd. When the last two bulls had been\nunloaded the herd were all together.\n\nThe steer who had been gored had gotten to his feet and stood against\nthe stone wall. None of the bulls came near him, and he did not attempt\nto join the herd.\n\nWe climbed down from the wall with the crowd, and had a last look at the\nbulls through the loopholes in the wall of the corral. They were all\nquiet now, their heads down. We got a carriage outside and rode up to\nthe café. Mike and Bill came in half an hour later. They had stopped on\nthe way for several drinks.\n\nWe were sitting in the café.\n\n“That’s an extraordinary business,” Brett said."}
{"text": "“Will those last ones fight as well as the first?” Robert Cohn asked.\n“They seemed to quiet down awfully fast.”\n\n“They all know each other,” I said. “They’re only dangerous when they’re\nalone, or only two or three of them together.”\n\n“What do you mean, dangerous?” Bill said. “They all looked dangerous to\nme.”\n\n“They only want to kill when they’re alone. Of course, if you went in\nthere you’d probably detach one of them from the herd, and he’d be\ndangerous.”\n\n“That’s too complicated,” Bill said. “Don’t you ever detach me from the\nherd, Mike.”\n\n“I say,” Mike said, “they _were_ fine bulls, weren’t they? Did you see\ntheir horns?”\n\n“Did I not,” said Brett. “I had no idea what they were like.”\n\n“Did you see the one hit that steer?” Mike asked. “That was\nextraordinary.”\n\n“It’s no life being a steer,” Robert Cohn said.\n\n“Don’t you think so?” Mike said. “I would have thought you’d loved being\na steer, Robert.”\n\n“What do you mean, Mike?”\n\n“They lead such a quiet life. They never say anything and they’re always\nhanging about so.”\n\nWe were embarrassed. Bill laughed. Robert Cohn was angry. Mike went on\ntalking.\n\n“I should think you’d love it. You’d never have to say a word. Come on,\nRobert. Do say something. Don’t just sit there.”\n\n“I said something, Mike. Don’t you remember? About the steers.”\n\n“Oh, say something more. Say something funny. Can’t you see we’re all\nhaving a good time here?”\n\n“Come off it, Michael. You’re drunk,” Brett said.\n\n“I’m not drunk. I’m quite serious. _Is_ Robert Cohn going to follow\nBrett around like a steer all the time?”\n\n“Shut up, Michael. Try and show a little breeding.”\n\n“Breeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls?\nAren’t the bulls lovely? Don’t you like them, Bill? Why don’t you say\nsomething, Robert? Don’t sit there looking like a bloody funeral. What\nif Brett did sleep with you? She’s slept with lots of better people than\nyou.”\n\n“Shut up,” Cohn said. He stood up. “Shut up, Mike.”\n\n“Oh, don’t stand up and act as though you were going to hit me. That\nwon’t make any difference to me. Tell me, Robert. Why do you follow\nBrett around like a poor bloody steer? Don’t you know you’re not wanted?\nI know when I’m not wanted. Why don’t you know when you’re not wanted?\nYou came down to San Sebastian where you weren’t wanted, and followed\nBrett around like a bloody steer. Do you think that’s right?”\n\n“Shut up. You’re drunk.”\n\n“Perhaps I am drunk. Why aren’t you drunk? Why don’t you ever get drunk,\nRobert? You know you didn’t have a good time at San Sebastian because\nnone of our friends would invite you on any of the parties. You can’t\nblame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to. They wouldn’t do it. You\ncan’t blame them, now. Can you? Now, answer me. Can you blame them?”\n\n“Go to hell, Mike.”\n\n“I can’t blame them. Can you blame them? Why do you follow Brett around?\nHaven’t you any manners? How do you think it makes _me_ feel?”\n\n“You’re a splendid one to talk about manners,” Brett said. “You’ve such\nlovely manners.”\n\n“Come on, Robert,” Bill said.\n\n“What do you follow her around for?”\n\nBill stood up and took hold of Cohn.\n\n“Don’t go,” Mike said. “Robert Cohn’s going to buy a drink.”\n\nBill went off with Cohn. Cohn’s face was sallow. Mike went on talking. I\nsat and listened for a while. Brett looked disgusted.\n\n“I say, Michael, you might not be such a bloody ass,” she interrupted.\n“I’m not saying he’s not right, you know.” She turned to me.\n\nThe emotion left Mike’s voice. We were all friends together.\n\n“I’m not so damn drunk as I sounded,” he said.\n\n“I know you’re not,” Brett said.\n\n“We’re none of us sober,” I said.\n\n“I didn’t say anything I didn’t mean.”\n\n“But you put it so badly,” Brett laughed.\n\n“He was an ass, though. He came down to San Sebastian where he damn well\nwasn’t wanted. He hung around Brett and just _looked_ at her. It made me\ndamned well sick.”\n\n“He did behave very badly,” Brett said.\n\n“Mark you. Brett’s had affairs with men before. She tells me all about\neverything. She gave me this chap Cohn’s letters to read. I wouldn’t\nread them.”\n\n“Damned noble of you.”\n\n“No, listen, Jake. Brett’s gone off with men. But they weren’t ever\nJews, and they didn’t come and hang about afterward.”"}
{"text": "“Damned good chaps,” Brett said. “It’s all rot to talk about it. Michael\nand I understand each other.”\n\n“She gave me Robert Cohn’s letters. I wouldn’t read them.”\n\n“You wouldn’t read any letters, darling. You wouldn’t read mine.”\n\n“I can’t read letters,” Mike said. “Funny, isn’t it?”\n\n“You can’t read anything.”\n\n“No. You’re wrong there. I read quite a bit. I read when I’m at home.”\n\n“You’ll be writing next,” Brett said. “Come on, Michael. Do buck up.\nYou’ve got to go through with this thing now. He’s here. Don’t spoil the\nfiesta.”\n\n“Well, let him behave, then.”\n\n“He’ll behave. I’ll tell him.”\n\n“You tell him, Jake. Tell him either he must behave or get out.”\n\n“Yes,” I said, “it would be nice for me to tell him.”\n\n“Look, Brett. Tell Jake what Robert calls you. That is perfect, you\nknow.”\n\n“Oh, no. I can’t.”\n\n“Go on. We’re all friends. Aren’t we all friends, Jake?”\n\n“I can’t tell him. It’s too ridiculous.”\n\n“I’ll tell him.”\n\n“You won’t, Michael. Don’t be an ass.”\n\n“He calls her Circe,” Mike said. “He claims she turns men into swine.\nDamn good. I wish I were one of these literary chaps.”\n\n“He’d be good, you know,” Brett said. “He writes a good letter.”\n\n“I know,” I said. “He wrote me from San Sebastian.”\n\n“That was nothing,” Brett said. “He can write a damned amusing letter.”\n\n“She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill.”\n\n“I damned well was, too.”\n\n“Come on,” I said, “we must go in and eat.”\n\n“How should I meet Cohn?” Mike said.\n\n“Just act as though nothing had happened.”\n\n“It’s quite all right with me,” Mike said. “I’m not embarrassed.”\n\n“If he says anything, just say you were tight.”\n\n“Quite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight.”\n\n“Come on,” Brett said. “Are these poisonous things paid for? I must\nbathe before dinner.”\n\nWe walked across the square. It was dark and all around the square were\nthe lights from the cafés under the arcades. We walked across the gravel\nunder the trees to the hotel.\n\nThey went up-stairs and I stopped to speak with Montoya.\n\n“Well, how did you like the bulls?” he asked.\n\n“Good. They were nice bulls.”\n\n“They’re all right”—Montoya shook his head—“but they’re not too good.”\n\n“What didn’t you like about them?”\n\n“I don’t know. They just didn’t give me the feeling that they were so\ngood.”\n\n“I know what you mean.”\n\n“They’re all right.”\n\n“Yes. They’re all right.”\n\n“How did your friends like them?”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“Good,” Montoya said.\n\nI went up-stairs. Bill was in his room standing on the balcony looking\nout at the square. I stood beside him.\n\n“Where’s Cohn?”\n\n“Up-stairs in his room.”\n\n“How does he feel?”\n\n“Like hell, naturally. Mike was awful. He’s terrible when he’s tight.”\n\n“He wasn’t so tight.”\n\n“The hell he wasn’t. I know what we had before we came to the café.”\n\n“He sobered up afterward.”\n\n“Good. He was terrible. I don’t like Cohn, God knows, and I think it was\na silly trick for him to go down to San Sebastian, but nobody has any\nbusiness to talk like Mike.”\n\n“How’d you like the bulls?”\n\n“Grand. It’s grand the way they bring them out.”\n\n“To-morrow come the Miuras.”\n\n“When does the fiesta start?”\n\n“Day after to-morrow.”\n\n“We’ve got to keep Mike from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is\nterrible.”\n\n“We’d better get cleaned up for supper.”\n\n“Yes. That will be a pleasant meal.”\n\n“Won’t it?”\n\nAs a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal. Brett wore a black,\nsleeveless evening dress. She looked quite beautiful. Mike acted as\nthough nothing had happened. I had to go up and bring Robert Cohn down.\nHe was reserved and formal, and his face was still taut and sallow, but\nhe cheered up finally. He could not stop looking at Brett. It seemed to\nmake him happy. It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so\nlovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it.\nThey could not take that away from him. Bill was very funny. So was\nMichael. They were good together.\n\nIt was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much\nwine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could\nnot prevent happening. Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and\nwas happy. It seemed they were all such nice people.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   14"}
{"text": "I do not know what time I got to bed. I remember undressing, putting on\na bathrobe, and standing out on the balcony. I knew I was quite drunk,\nand when I came in I put on the light over the head of the bed and\nstarted to read. I was reading a book by Turgenieff. Probably I read the\nsame two pages over several times. It was one of the stories in “A\nSportsman’s Sketches.” I had read it before, but it seemed quite new.\nThe country became very clear and the feeling of pressure in my head\nseemed to loosen. I was very drunk and I did not want to shut my eyes\nbecause the room would go round and round. If I kept on reading that\nfeeling would pass.\n\nI heard Brett and Robert Cohn come up the stairs. Cohn said good night\noutside the door and went on up to his room. I heard Brett go into the\nroom next door. Mike was already in bed. He had come in with me an hour\nbefore. He woke as she came in, and they talked together. I heard them\nlaugh. I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep. It was not\nnecessary to read any more. I could shut my eyes without getting the\nwheeling sensation. But I could not sleep. There is no reason why\nbecause it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is\nlight. The hell there isn’t!\n\nI figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the\nelectric light off. That was another bright idea. To hell with women,\nanyway. To hell with you, Brett Ashley.\n\nWomen made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you\nhad to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been\nhaving Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it.\nI had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the\npresentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the\nswell things you could count on.\n\nI thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays\nand pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values.\nYou gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for\nsomething. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my\nway into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either\nyou paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances,\nor by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money’s worth and\nknowing when you had it. You could get your money’s worth. The world was\na good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years,\nI thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies\nI’ve had.\n\nPerhaps that wasn’t true, though. Perhaps as you went along you did\nlearn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to\nknow was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you\nlearned from that what it was all about.\n\nI wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though. Mike was a\nbad drunk. Brett was a good drunk. Bill was a good drunk. Cohn was never\ndrunk. Mike was unpleasant after he passed a certain point. I liked to\nsee him hurt Cohn. I wished he would not do it, though, because\nafterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that\nmade you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality. That was a\nlarge statement. What a lot of bilge I could think up at night. What\nrot, I could hear Brett say it. What rot! When you were with English you\ngot into the habit of using English expressions in your thinking. The\nEnglish spoken language—the upper classes, anyway—must have fewer\nwords than the Eskimo. Of course I didn’t know anything about the\nEskimo. Maybe the Eskimo was a fine language. Say the Cherokee. I didn’t\nknow anything about the Cherokee, either. The English talked with\ninflected phrases. One phrase to mean everything. I liked them, though.\nI liked the way they talked. Take Harris. Still Harris was not the upper\nclasses."}
{"text": "I turned on the light again and read. I read the Turgenieff. I knew that\nnow, reading it in the oversensitized state of my mind after much too\nmuch brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem\nas though it had really happened to me. I would always have it. That was\nanother good thing you paid for and then had. Some time along toward\ndaylight I went to sleep.\n\n*        *        *        *        *\n\nThe next two days in Pamplona were quiet, and there were no more rows.\nThe town was getting ready for the fiesta. Workmen put up the gate-posts\nthat were to shut off the side streets when the bulls were released from\nthe corrals and came running through the streets in the morning on their\nway to the ring. The workmen dug holes and fitted in the timbers, each\ntimber numbered for its regular place. Out on the plateau beyond the\ntown employees of the bull-ring exercised picador horses, galloping them\nstiff-legged on the hard, sun-baked fields behind the bull-ring. The big\ngate of the bull-ring was open, and inside the amphitheatre was being\nswept. The ring was rolled and sprinkled, and carpenters replaced\nweakened or cracked planks in the barrera. Standing at the edge of the\nsmooth rolled sand you could look up in the empty stands and see old\nwomen sweeping out the boxes.\n\nOutside, the fence that led from the last street of the town to the\nentrance of the bull-ring was already in place and made a long pen; the\ncrowd would come running down with the bulls behind them on the morning\nof the day of the first bull-fight. Out across the plain, where the\nhorse and cattle fair would be, some gypsies had camped under the trees.\nThe wine and aguardiente sellers were putting up their booths. One booth\nadvertised =ANIS DEL TORO=. The cloth sign hung against the\nplanks in the hot sun. In the big square that was the centre of the town\nthere was no change yet. We sat in the white wicker chairs on the\nterrasse of the café and watched the motor-buses come in and unload\npeasants from the country coming in to the market, and we watched the\nbuses fill up and start out with peasants sitting with their saddle-bags\nfull of the things they had bought in the town. The tall gray\nmotor-buses were the only life of the square except for the pigeons and\nthe man with a hose who sprinkled the gravelled square and watered the\nstreets.\n\nIn the evening was the paseo. For an hour after dinner every one, all\nthe good-looking girls, the officers from the garrison, all the\nfashionable people of the town, walked in the street on one side of the\nsquare while the café tables filled with the regular after-dinner crowd.\n\nDuring the morning I usually sat in the café and read the Madrid papers\nand then walked in the town or out into the country. Sometimes Bill went\nalong. Sometimes he wrote in his room. Robert Cohn spent the mornings\nstudying Spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop. Brett and\nMike never got up until noon. We all had a vermouth at the café. It was\na quiet life and no one was drunk. I went to church a couple of times,\nonce with Brett. She said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but I\ntold her that not only was it impossible but it was not as interesting\nas it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know.\nWe met Cohn as we came out of church, and although it was obvious he had\nfollowed us, yet he was very pleasant and nice, and we all three went\nfor a walk out to the gypsy camp, and Brett had her fortune told.\n\nIt was a good morning, there were high white clouds above the mountains.\nIt had rained a little in the night and it was fresh and cool on the\nplateau, and there was a wonderful view. We all felt good and we felt\nhealthy, and I felt quite friendly to Cohn. You could not be upset about\nanything on a day like that.\n\nThat was the last day before the fiesta.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   15"}
{"text": "At noon of Sunday, the 6th of July, the fiesta exploded. There is no\nother way to describe it. People had been coming in all day from the\ncountry, but they were assimilated in the town and you did not notice\nthem. The square was as quiet in the hot sun as on any other day. The\npeasants were in the outlying wine-shops. There they were drinking,\ngetting ready for the fiesta. They had come in so recently from the\nplains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting\nin values gradually. They could not start in paying café prices. They\ngot their money’s worth in the wine-shops. Money still had a definite\nvalue in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it\nwould not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.\n\nNow on the day of the starting of the fiesta of San Fermin they had been\nin the wine-shops of the narrow streets of the town since early morning.\nGoing down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the\ncathedral, I heard them singing through the open doors of the shops.\nThey were warming up. There were many people at the eleven o’clock mass.\nSan Fermin is also a religious festival.\n\nI walked down the hill from the cathedral and up the street to the café\non the square. It was a little before noon. Robert Cohn and Bill were\nsitting at one of the tables. The marble-topped tables and the white\nwicker chairs were gone. They were replaced by cast-iron tables and\nsevere folding chairs. The café was like a battleship stripped for\naction. To-day the waiters did not leave you alone all morning to read\nwithout asking if you wanted to order something. A waiter came up as\nsoon as I sat down.\n\n“What are you drinking?” I asked Bill and Robert.\n\n“Sherry,” Cohn said.\n\n“Jerez,” I said to the waiter.\n\nBefore the waiter brought the sherry the rocket that announced the\nfiesta went up in the square. It burst and there was a gray ball of\nsmoke high up above the Theatre Gayarre, across on the other side of the\nplaza. The ball of smoke hung in the sky like a shrapnel burst, and as I\nwatched, another rocket came up to it, trickling smoke in the bright\nsunlight. I saw the bright flash as it burst and another little cloud of\nsmoke appeared. By the time the second rocket had burst there were so\nmany people in the arcade, that had been empty a minute before, that the\nwaiter, holding the bottle high up over his head, could hardly get\nthrough the crowd to our table. People were coming into the square from\nall sides, and down the street we heard the pipes and the fifes and the\ndrums coming. They were playing the _riau-riau_ music, the pipes shrill\nand the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing.\nWhen the fifers stopped they all crouched down in the street, and when\nthe reed-pipes and the fifes shrilled, and the flat, dry, hollow drums\ntapped it out again, they all went up in the air dancing. In the crowd\nyou saw only the heads and shoulders of the dancers going up and down.\n\nIn the square a man, bent over, was playing on a reed-pipe, and a crowd\nof children were following him shouting, and pulling at his clothes. He\ncame out of the square, the children following him, and piped them past\nthe café and down a side street. We saw his blank pockmarked face as he\nwent by, piping, the children close behind him shouting and pulling at\nhim.\n\n“He must be the village idiot,” Bill said. “My God! look at that!”\n\nDown the street came dancers. The street was solid with dancers, all\nmen. They were all dancing in time behind their own fifers and drummers.\nThey were a club of some sort, and all wore workmen’s blue smocks, and\nred handkerchiefs around their necks, and carried a great banner on two\npoles. The banner danced up and down with them as they came down\nsurrounded by the crowd.\n\n“Hurray for Wine! Hurray for the Foreigners!” was painted on the banner.\n\n“Where are the foreigners?” Robert Cohn asked.\n\n“We’re the foreigners,” Bill said.\n\nAll the time rockets were going up. The café tables were all full now.\nThe square was emptying of people and the crowd was filling the cafés.\n\n“Where’s Brett and Mike?” Bill asked.\n\n“I’ll go and get them,” Cohn said."}
{"text": "“Bring them here.”\n\nThe fiesta was really started. It kept up day and night for seven days.\nThe dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on. The things\nthat happened could only have happened during a fiesta. Everything\nbecame quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have\nany consequences. It seemed out of place to think of consequences during\nthe fiesta. All during the fiesta you had the feeling, even when it was\nquiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard. It was the\nsame feeling about any action. It was a fiesta and it went on for seven\ndays.\n\nThat afternoon was the big religious procession. San Fermin was\ntranslated from one church to another. In the procession were all the\ndignitaries, civil and religious. We could not see them because the\ncrowd was too great. Ahead of the formal procession and behind it danced\nthe _riau-riau_ dancers. There was one mass of yellow shirts dancing up\nand down in the crowd. All we could see of the procession through the\nclosely pressed people that crowded all the side streets and curbs were\nthe great giants, cigar-store Indians, thirty feet high, Moors, a King\nand Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the _riau-riau_.\n\nThey were all standing outside the chapel where San Fermin and the\ndignitaries had passed in, leaving a guard of soldiers, the giants, with\nthe men who danced in them standing beside their resting frames, and the\ndwarfs moving with their whacking bladders through the crowd. We started\ninside and there was a smell of incense and people filing back into the\nchurch, but Brett was stopped just inside the door because she had no\nhat, so we went out again and along the street that ran back from the\nchapel into town. The street was lined on both sides with people keeping\ntheir place at the curb for the return of the procession. Some dancers\nformed a circle around Brett and started to dance. They wore big wreaths\nof white garlics around their necks. They took Bill and me by the arms\nand put us in the circle. Bill started to dance, too. They were all\nchanting. Brett wanted to dance but they did not want her to. They\nwanted her as an image to dance around. When the song ended with the\nsharp _riau-riau!_ they rushed us into a wine-shop.\n\nWe stood at the counter. They had Brett seated on a wine-cask. It was\ndark in the wine-shop and full of men singing, hard-voiced singing. Back\nof the counter they drew the wine from casks. I put down money for the\nwine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket.\n\n“I want a leather wine-bottle,” Bill said.\n\n“There’s a place down the street,” I said. “I’ll go get a couple.”\n\nThe dancers did not want me to go out. Three of them were sitting on the\nhigh wine-cask beside Brett, teaching her to drink out of the\nwine-skins. They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck. Some one\ninsisted on giving her a glass. Somebody was teaching Bill a song.\nSinging it into his ear. Beating time on Bill’s back.\n\nI explained to them that I would be back. Outside in the street I went\ndown the street looking for the shop that made leather wine-bottles. The\ncrowd was packed on the sidewalks and many of the shops were shuttered,\nand I could not find it. I walked as far as the church, looking on both\nsides of the street. Then I asked a man and he took me by the arm and\nled me to it. The shutters were up but the door was open.\n\nInside it smelled of fresh tanned leather and hot tar. A man was\nstencilling completed wine-skins. They hung from the roof in bunches. He\ntook one down, blew it up, screwed the nozzle tight, and then jumped on\nit\n\n“See! It doesn’t leak.”\n\n“I want another one, too. A big one.”\n\nHe took down a big one that would hold a gallon or more, from the roof.\nHe blew it up, his cheeks puffing ahead of the wine-skin, and stood on\nthe bota holding on to a chair.\n\n“What are you going to do? Sell them in Bayonne?”\n\n“No. Drink out of them.”\n\nHe slapped me on the back.\n\n“Good man. Eight pesetas for the two. The lowest price.”\n\nThe man who was stencilling the new ones and tossing them into a pile\nstopped.\n\n“It’s true,” he said. “Eight pesetas is cheap.”"}
{"text": "I paid and went out and along the street back to the wine-shop. It was\ndarker than ever inside and very crowded. I did not see Brett and Bill,\nand some one said they were in the back room. At the counter the girl\nfilled the two wine-skins for me. One held two litres. The other held\nfive litres. Filling them both cost three pesetas sixty centimos. Some\none at the counter, that I had never seen before, tried to pay for the\nwine, but I finally paid for it myself. The man who had wanted to pay\nthen bought me a drink. He would not let me buy one in return, but said\nhe would take a rinse of the mouth from the new wine-bag. He tipped the\nbig five-litre bag up and squeezed it so the wine hissed against the\nback of his throat.\n\n“All right,” he said, and handed back the bag.\n\nIn the back room Brett and Bill were sitting on barrels surrounded by\nthe dancers. Everybody had his arms on everybody else’s shoulders, and\nthey were all singing. Mike was sitting at a table with several men in\ntheir shirt-sleeves, eating from a bowl of tuna fish, chopped onions and\nvinegar. They were all drinking wine and mopping up the oil and vinegar\nwith pieces of bread.\n\n“Hello, Jake. Hello!” Mike called. “Come here. I want you to meet my\nfriends. We’re all having an hors-d’œuvre.”\n\nI was introduced to the people at the table. They supplied their names\nto Mike and sent for a fork for me.\n\n“Stop eating their dinner, Michael,” Brett shouted from the\nwine-barrels.\n\n“I don’t want to eat up your meal,” I said when some one handed me a\nfork.\n\n“Eat,” he said. “What do you think it’s here for?”\n\nI unscrewed the nozzle of the big wine-bottle and handed it around.\nEvery one took a drink, tipping the wine-skin at arm’s length.\n\nOutside, above the singing, we could hear the music of the procession\ngoing by.\n\n“Isn’t that the procession?” Mike asked.\n\n“Nada,” some one said. “It’s nothing. Drink up. Lift the bottle.”\n\n“Where did they find you?” I asked Mike.\n\n“Some one brought me here,” Mike said. “They said you were here.”\n\n“Where’s Cohn?”\n\n“He’s passed out,” Brett called. “They’ve put him away somewhere.”\n\n“Where is he?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“How should we know,” Bill said. “I think he’s dead.”\n\n“He’s not dead,” Mike said. “I know he’s not dead. He’s just passed out\non Anis del Mono.”\n\nAs he said Anis del Mono one of the men at the table looked up, brought\nout a bottle from inside his smock, and handed it to me.\n\n“No,” I said. “No, thanks!”\n\n“Yes. Yes. Arriba! Up with the bottle!”\n\nI took a drink. It tasted of licorice and warmed all the way. I could\nfeel it warming in my stomach.\n\n“Where the hell is Cohn?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Mike said. “I’ll ask. Where is the drunken comrade?” he\nasked in Spanish.\n\n“You want to see him?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\n“Not me,” said Mike. “This gent.”\n\nThe Anis del Mono man wiped his mouth and stood up.\n\n“Come on.”\n\nIn a back room Robert Cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks. It\nwas almost too dark to see his face. They had covered him with a coat\nand another coat was folded under his head. Around his neck and on his\nchest was a big wreath of twisted garlics.\n\n“Let him sleep,” the man whispered. “He’s all right.”\n\nTwo hours later Cohn appeared. He came into the front room still with\nthe wreath of garlics around his neck. The Spaniards shouted when he\ncame in. Cohn wiped his eyes and grinned.\n\n“I must have been sleeping,” he said.\n\n“Oh, not at all,” Brett said.\n\n“You were only dead,” Bill said.\n\n“Aren’t we going to go and have some supper?” Cohn asked.\n\n“Do you want to eat?”\n\n“Yes. Why not? I’m hungry.”\n\n“Eat those garlics, Robert,” Mike said. “I say. Do eat those garlics.”\n\nCohn stood there. His sleep had made him quite all right.\n\n“Do let’s go and eat,” Brett said. “I must get a bath.”\n\n“Come on,” Bill said. “Let’s translate Brett to the hotel.”\n\nWe said good-bye to many people and shook hands with many people and\nwent out. Outside it was dark.\n\n“What time is it do you suppose?” Cohn asked.\n\n“It’s to-morrow,” Mike said. “You’ve been asleep two days.”\n\n“No,” said Cohn, “what time is it?”\n\n“It’s ten o’clock.”\n\n“What a lot we’ve drunk.”\n\n“You mean what a lot _we’ve_ drunk. You went to sleep.”"}
{"text": "Going down the dark streets to the hotel we saw the sky-rockets going up\nin the square. Down the side streets that led to the square we saw the\nsquare solid with people, those in the centre all dancing.\n\nIt was a big meal at the hotel. It was the first meal of the prices\nbeing doubled for the fiesta, and there were several new courses. After\nthe dinner we were out in the town. I remember resolving that I would\nstay up all night to watch the bulls go through the streets at six\no’clock in the morning, and being so sleepy that I went to bed around\nfour o’clock. The others stayed up.\n\nMy own room was locked and I could not find the key, so I went up-stairs\nand slept on one of the beds in Cohn’s room. The fiesta was going on\noutside in the night, but I was too sleepy for it to keep me awake. When\nI woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the\nrelease of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town. They would\nrace through the streets and out to the bull-ring. I had been sleeping\nheavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of Cohn’s and\nwent out on the balcony. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the\nbalconies were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the\nstreet. They were all running, packed close together. They passed along\nand up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men\nrunning faster, and then some stragglers who were really running. Behind\nthem was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing\ntheir heads up and down. It all went out of sight around the corner. One\nman fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the bulls went right\non and did not notice him. They were all running together.\n\nAfter they went out of sight a great roar came from the bull-ring. It\nkept on. Then finally the pop of the rocket that meant the bulls had\ngotten through the people in the ring and into the corrals. I went back\nin the room and got into bed. I had been standing on the stone balcony\nin bare feet. I knew our crowd must have all been out at the bull-ring.\nBack in bed, I went to sleep.\n\nCohn woke me when he came in. He started to undress and went over and\nclosed the window because the people on the balcony of the house just\nacross the street were looking in.\n\n“Did you see the show?” I asked.\n\n“Yes. We were all there.”\n\n“Anybody get hurt?”\n\n“One of the bulls got into the crowd in the ring and tossed six or eight\npeople.”\n\n“How did Brett like it?”\n\n“It was all so sudden there wasn’t any time for it to bother anybody.”\n\n“I wish I’d been up.”\n\n“We didn’t know where you were. We went to your room but it was locked.”\n\n“Where did you stay up?”\n\n“We danced at some club.”\n\n“I got sleepy,” I said.\n\n“My gosh! I’m sleepy now,” Cohn said. “Doesn’t this thing ever stop?”\n\n“Not for a week.”\n\nBill opened the door and put his head in.\n\n“Where were you, Jake?”\n\n“I saw them go through from the balcony. How was it?”\n\n“Grand.”\n\n“Where you going?”\n\n“To sleep.”\n\nNo one was up before noon. We ate at tables set out under the arcade.\nThe town was full of people. We had to wait for a table. After lunch we\nwent over to the Iruña. It had filled up, and as the time for the\nbull-fight came it got fuller, and the tables were crowded closer. There\nwas a close, crowded hum that came every day before the bull-fight. The\ncafé did not make this same noise at any other time, no matter how\ncrowded it was. This hum went on, and we were in it and a part of it.\n\nI had taken six seats for all the fights. Three of them were barreras,\nthe first row at the ring-side, and three were sobrepuertos, seats with\nwooden backs, half-way up the amphitheatre. Mike thought Brett had best\nsit high up for her first time, and Cohn wanted to sit with them. Bill\nand I were going to sit in the barreras, and I gave the extra ticket to\na waiter to sell. Bill said something to Cohn about what to do and how\nto look so he would not mind the horses. Bill had seen one season of\nbull-fights.\n\n“I’m not worried about how I’ll stand it. I’m only afraid I may be\nbored,” Cohn said.\n\n“You think so?”"}
{"text": "“Don’t look at the horses, after the bull hits them,” I said to Brett.\n“Watch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, but\nthen don’t look again until the horse is dead if it’s been hit.”\n\n“I’m a little nervy about it,” Brett said. “I’m worried whether I’ll be\nable to go through with it all right.”\n\n“You’ll be all right. There’s nothing but that horse part that will\nbother you, and they’re only in for a few minutes with each bull. Just\ndon’t watch when it’s bad.”\n\n“She’ll be all right,” Mike said. “I’ll look after her.”\n\n“I don’t think you’ll be bored,” Bill said.\n\n“I’m going over to the hotel to get the glasses and the wine-skin,” I\nsaid. “See you back here. Don’t get cock-eyed.”\n\n“I’ll come along,” Bill said. Brett smiled at us.\n\nWe walked around through the arcade to avoid the heat of the square.\n\n“That Cohn gets me,” Bill said. “He’s got this Jewish superiority so\nstrong that he thinks the only emotion he’ll get out of the fight will\nbe being bored.”\n\n“We’ll watch him with the glasses,” I said.\n\n“Oh, to hell with him!”\n\n“He spends a lot of time there.”\n\n“I want him to stay there.”\n\nIn the hotel on the stairs we met Montoya.\n\n“Come on,” said Montoya. “Do you want to meet Pedro Romero?”\n\n“Fine,” said Bill. “Let’s go see him.”\n\nWe followed Montoya up a flight and down the corridor.\n\n“He’s in room number eight,” Montoya explained. “He’s getting dressed\nfor the bull-fight.”\n\nMontoya knocked on the door and opened it. It was a gloomy room with a\nlittle light coming in from the window on the narrow street. There were\ntwo beds separated by a monastic partition. The electric light was on.\nThe boy stood very straight and unsmiling in his bull-fighting clothes.\nHis jacket hung over the back of a chair. They were just finishing\nwinding his sash. His black hair shone under the electric light. He wore\na white linen shirt and the sword-handler finished his sash and stood up\nand stepped back. Pedro Romero nodded, seeming very far away and\ndignified when we shook hands. Montoya said something about what great\naficionados we were, and that we wanted to wish him luck. Romero\nlistened very seriously. Then he turned to me. He was the best-looking\nboy I have ever seen.\n\n“You go to the bull-fight,” he said in English.\n\n“You know English,” I said, feeling like an idiot.\n\n“No,” he answered, and smiled.\n\nOne of three men who had been sitting on the beds came up and asked us\nif we spoke French. “Would you like me to interpret for you? Is there\nanything you would like to ask Pedro Romero?”\n\nWe thanked him. What was there that you would like to ask? The boy was\nnineteen years old, alone except for his sword-handler, and the three\nhangers-on, and the bull-fight was to commence in twenty minutes. We\nwished him “Mucha suerte,” shook hands, and went out. He was standing,\nstraight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with\nthe hangers-on as we shut the door.\n\n“He’s a fine boy, don’t you think so?” Montoya asked.\n\n“He’s a good-looking kid,” I said.\n\n“He looks like a torero,” Montoya said. “He has the type.”\n\n“He’s a fine boy.”\n\n“We’ll see how he is in the ring,” Montoya said.\n\nWe found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my\nroom, took it and the field-glasses, locked the door, and went\ndown-stairs.\n\nIt was a good bull-fight. Bill and I were very excited about Pedro\nRomero. Montoya was sitting about ten places away. After Romero had\nkilled his first bull Montoya caught my eye and nodded his head. This\nwas a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. Of the\nother two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable. But\nthere was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was\nmuch.\n\nSeveral times during the bull-fight I looked up at Mike and Brett and\nCohn, with the glasses. They seemed to be all right. Brett did not look\nupset. All three were leaning forward on the concrete railing in front\nof them.\n\n“Let me take the glasses,” Bill said.\n\n“Does Cohn look bored?” I asked.\n\n“That kike!”"}
{"text": "Outside the ring, after the bull-fight was over, you could not move in\nthe crowd. We could not make our way through but had to be moved with\nthe whole thing, slowly, as a glacier, back to town. We had that\ndisturbed emotional feeling that always comes after a bull-fight, and\nthe feeling of elation that comes after a good bull-fight. The fiesta\nwas going on. The drums pounded and the pipe music was shrill, and\neverywhere the flow of the crowd was broken by patches of dancers. The\ndancers were in a crowd, so you did not see the intricate play of the\nfeet. All you saw was the heads and shoulders going up and down, up and\ndown. Finally, we got out of the crowd and made for the café. The waiter\nsaved chairs for the others, and we each ordered an absinthe and watched\nthe crowd in the square and the dancers.\n\n“What do you suppose that dance is?” Bill asked.\n\n“It’s a sort of jota.”\n\n“They’re not all the same,” Bill said. “They dance differently to all\nthe different tunes.”\n\n“It’s swell dancing.”\n\nIn front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were\ndancing. The steps were very intricate and their faces were intent and\nconcentrated. They all looked down while they danced. Their rope-soled\nshoes tapped and spatted on the pavement. The toes touched. The heels\ntouched. The balls of the feet touched. Then the music broke wildly and\nthe step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street.\n\n“Here come the gentry,” Bill said.\n\nThey were crossing the street\n\n“Hello, men,” I said.\n\n“Hello, gents!” said Brett. “You saved us seats? How nice.”\n\n“I say,” Mike said, “that Romero what’shisname is somebody. Am I wrong?”\n\n“Oh, isn’t he lovely,” Brett said. “And those green trousers.”\n\n“Brett never took her eyes off them.”\n\n“I say, I must borrow your glasses to-morrow.”\n\n“How did it go?”\n\n“Wonderfully! Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle!”\n\n“How about the horses?”\n\n“I couldn’t help looking at them.”\n\n“She couldn’t take her eyes off them,” Mike said. “She’s an\nextraordinary wench.”\n\n“They do have some rather awful things happen to them,” Brett said. “I\ncouldn’t look away, though.”\n\n“Did you feel all right?”\n\n“I didn’t feel badly at all.”\n\n“Robert Cohn did,” Mike put in. “You were quite green, Robert.”\n\n“The first horse did bother me,” Cohn said.\n\n“You weren’t bored, were you?” asked Bill.\n\nCohn laughed.\n\n“No. I wasn’t bored. I wish you’d forgive me that.”\n\n“It’s all right,” Bill said, “so long as you weren’t bored.”\n\n“He didn’t look bored,” Mike said. “I thought he was going to be sick.”\n\n“I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute.”\n\n“I thought he was going to be sick. You weren’t bored, were you,\nRobert?”\n\n“Let up on that, Mike. I said I was sorry I said it.”\n\n“He was, you know. He was positively green.”\n\n“Oh, shove it along, Michael.”\n\n“You mustn’t ever get bored at your first bull-fight, Robert,” Mike\nsaid. “It might make such a mess.”\n\n“Oh, shove it along, Michael,” Brett said.\n\n“He said Brett was a sadist,” Mike said. “Brett’s not a sadist. She’s\njust a lovely, healthy wench.”\n\n“Are you a sadist, Brett?” I asked.\n\n“Hope not.”\n\n“He said Brett was a sadist just because she has a good, healthy\nstomach.”\n\n“Won’t be healthy long.”\n\nBill got Mike started on something else than Cohn. The waiter brought\nthe absinthe glasses.\n\n“Did you really like it?” Bill asked Cohn.\n\n“No, I can’t say I liked it. I think it’s a wonderful show.”\n\n“Gad, yes! What a spectacle!” Brett said.\n\n“I wish they didn’t have the horse part,” Cohn said.\n\n“They’re not important,” Bill said. “After a while you never notice\nanything disgusting.”\n\n“It is a bit strong just at the start,” Brett said. “There’s a dreadful\nmoment for me just when the bull starts for the horse.”\n\n“The bulls were fine,” Cohn said.\n\n“They were very good,” Mike said.\n\n“I want to sit down below, next time.” Brett drank from her glass of\nabsinthe.\n\n“She wants to see the bull-fighters close by,” Mike said.\n\n“They are something,” Brett said. “That Romero lad is just a child.”\n\n“He’s a damned good-looking boy,” I said. “When we were up in his room I\nnever saw a better-looking kid.”\n\n“How old do you suppose he is?”\n\n“Nineteen or twenty.”\n\n“Just imagine it.”"}
{"text": "The bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first.\nBrett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up\nabove. Romero was the whole show. I do not think Brett saw any other\nbull-fighter. No one else did either, except the hard-shelled\ntechnicians. It was all Romero. There were two other matadors, but they\ndid not count. I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all\nabout. I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls\ncharged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the\npoint of his pic so that she saw what it was all about, so that it\nbecame more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of\na spectacle with unexplained horrors. I had her watch how Romero took\nthe bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him\nwith the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the\nbull. She saw how Romero avoided every brusque movement and saved his\nbulls for the last when he wanted them, not winded and discomposed but\nsmoothly worn down. She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull,\nand I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make\nit look as though they were working closely. She saw why she liked\nRomero’s cape-work and why she did not like the others.\n\nRomero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and\nnatural in line. The others twisted themselves like corkscrews, their\nelbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns\nhad passed, to give a faked look of danger. Afterward, all that was\nfaked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling. Romero’s bull-fighting\ngave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his\nmovements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close\neach time. He did not have to emphasize their closeness. Brett saw how\nsomething that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it\nwere done a little way off. I told her how since the death of Joselito\nall the bull-fighters had been developing a technic that simulated this\nappearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while\nthe bull-fighter was really safe. Romero had the old thing, the holding\nof his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he\ndominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he\nprepared him for the killing.\n\n“I’ve never seen him do an awkward thing,” Brett said.\n\n“You won’t until he gets frightened,” I said.\n\n“He’ll never be frightened,” Mike said. “He knows too damned much.”\n\n“He knew everything when he started. The others can’t ever learn what he\nwas born with.”\n\n“And God, what looks,” Brett said.\n\n“I believe, you know, that she’s falling in love with this bull-fighter\nchap,” Mike said.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised.”\n\n“Be a good chap, Jake. Don’t tell her anything more about him. Tell her\nhow they beat their old mothers.”\n\n“Tell me what drunks they are.”\n\n“Oh, frightful,” Mike said. “Drunk all day and spend all their time\nbeating their poor old mothers.”\n\n“He looks that way,” Brett said.\n\n“Doesn’t he?” I said.\n\nThey had hitched the mules to the dead bull and then the whips cracked,\nthe men ran, and the mules, straining forward, their legs pushing, broke\ninto a gallop, and the bull, one horn up, his head on its side, swept a\nswath smoothly across the sand and out the red gate.\n\n“This next is the last one.”\n\n“Not really,” Brett said. She leaned forward on the barrera. Romero\nwaved his picadors to their places, then stood, his cape against his\nchest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out.\n\nAfter it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd.\n\n“These bull-fights are hell on one,” Brett said. “I’m limp as a rag.”\n\n“Oh, you’ll get a drink,” Mike said.\n\nThe next day Pedro Romero did not fight. It was Miura bulls, and a very\nbad bull-fight. The next day there was no bull-fight scheduled. But all\nday and all night the fiesta kept on.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   16"}
{"text": "In the morning it was raining. A fog had come over the mountains from\nthe sea. You could not see the tops of the mountains. The plateau was\ndull and gloomy, and the shapes of the trees and the houses were\nchanged. I walked out beyond the town to look at the weather. The bad\nweather was coming over the mountains from the sea.\n\nThe flags in the square hung wet from the white poles and the banners\nwere wet and hung damp against the front of the houses, and in between\nthe steady drizzle the rain came down and drove every one under the\narcades and made pools of water in the square, and the streets wet and\ndark and deserted; yet the fiesta kept up without any pause. It was only\ndriven under cover.\n\nThe covered seats of the bull-ring had been crowded with people sitting\nout of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers\nand singers, and afterward the Val Carlos dancers in their costumes\ndanced down the street in the rain, the drums sounding hollow and damp,\nand the chiefs of the bands riding ahead on their big, heavy-footed\nhorses, their costumes wet, the horses’ coats wet in the rain. The crowd\nwas in the cafés and the dancers came in, too, and sat, their\ntight-wound white legs under the tables, shaking the water from their\nbelled caps, and spreading their red and purple jackets over the chairs\nto dry. It was raining hard outside.\n\nI left the crowd in the café and went over to the hotel to get shaved\nfor dinner. I was shaving in my room when there was a knock on the door.\n\n“Come in,” I called.\n\nMontoya walked in.\n\n“How are you?” he said.\n\n“Fine,” I said.\n\n“No bulls to-day.”\n\n“No,” I said, “nothing but rain.”\n\n“Where are your friends?”\n\n“Over at the Iruña.”\n\nMontoya smiled his embarrassed smile.\n\n“Look,” he said. “Do you know the American ambassador?”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “Everybody knows the American ambassador.”\n\n“He’s here in town, now.”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “Everybody’s seen them.”\n\n“I’ve seen them, too,” Montoya said. He didn’t say anything. I went on\nshaving.\n\n“Sit down,” I said. “Let me send for a drink.”\n\n“No, I have to go.”\n\nI finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with\ncold water. Montoya was standing there looking more embarrassed.\n\n“Look,” he said. “I’ve just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel\nthat they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee\nto-night after dinner.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “it can’t hurt Marcial any.”\n\n“Marcial has been in San Sebastian all day. He drove over in a car this\nmorning with Marquez. I don’t think they’ll be back to-night.”\n\nMontoya stood embarrassed. He wanted me to say something.\n\n“Don’t give Romero the message,” I said.\n\n“You think so?”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\nMontoya was very pleased.\n\n“I wanted to ask you because you were an American,” he said.\n\n“That’s what I’d do.”\n\n“Look,” said Montoya. “People take a boy like that. They don’t know what\nhe’s worth. They don’t know what he means. Any foreigner can flatter\nhim. They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they’re\nthrough.”\n\n“Like Algabeno,” I said.\n\n“Yes, like Algabeno.”\n\n“They’re a fine lot,” I said. “There’s one American woman down here now\nthat collects bull-fighters.”\n\n“I know. They only want the young ones.”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “The old ones get fat.”\n\n“Or crazy like Gallo.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “it’s easy. All you have to do is not give him the\nmessage.”\n\n“He’s such a fine boy,” said Montoya. “He ought to stay with his own\npeople. He shouldn’t mix in that stuff.”\n\n“Won’t you have a drink?” I asked.\n\n“No,” said Montoya, “I have to go.” He went out.\n\nI went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the\narcades around the square. It was still raining. I looked in at the\nIruña for the gang and they were not there, so I walked on around the\nsquare and back to the hotel. They were eating dinner in the down-stairs\ndining-room.\n\nThey were well ahead of me and it was no use trying to catch them. Bill\nwas buying shoe-shines for Mike. Bootblacks opened the street door and\neach one Bill called over and started to work on Mike.\n\n“This is the eleventh time my boots have been polished,” Mike said. “I\nsay, Bill is an ass.”\n\nThe bootblacks had evidently spread the report. Another came in.\n\n“Limpia botas?” he said to Bill."}
{"text": "“No,” said Bill. “For this Señor.”\n\nThe bootblack knelt down beside the one at work and started on Mike’s\nfree shoe that shone already in the electric light.\n\n“Bill’s a yell of laughter,” Mike said.\n\nI was drinking red wine, and so far behind them that I felt a little\nuncomfortable about all this shoe-shining. I looked around the room. At\nthe next table was Pedro Romero. He stood up when I nodded, and asked me\nto come over and meet a friend. His table was beside ours, almost\ntouching. I met the friend, a Madrid bull-fight critic, a little man\nwith a drawn face. I told Romero how much I liked his work, and he was\nvery pleased. We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French. I\nreached to our table for my wine-bottle, but the critic took my arm.\nRomero laughed.\n\n“Drink here,” he said in English.\n\nHe was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased\nwith it, and as we went on talking he brought out words he was not sure\nof, and asked me about them. He was anxious to know the English for\n_Corrida de toros_, the exact translation. Bull-fight he was suspicious\nof. I explained that bull-fight in Spanish was the _lidia_ of a _toro_.\nThe Spanish word _corrida_ means in English the running of bulls—the\nFrench translation is _Course de taureaux_. The critic put that in.\nThere is no Spanish word for bull-fight.\n\nPedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar. He was\nborn in Ronda. That is not far above Gibraltar. He started bull-fighting\nin Malaga in the bull-fighting school there. He had only been at it\nthree years. The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of\n_Malagueño_ expressions he used. He was nineteen years old, he said. His\nolder brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in\nthis hotel. He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked\nfor Romero. He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring. I\ntold him only three. It was really only two, but I did not want to\nexplain after I had made the mistake.\n\n“Where did you see me the other time? In Madrid?”\n\n“Yes,” I lied. I had read the accounts of his two appearances in Madrid\nin the bull-fight papers, so I was all right.\n\n“The first or the second time?”\n\n“The first.”\n\n“I was very bad,” he said. “The second time I was better. You remember?”\nHe turned to the critic.\n\nHe was not at all embarrassed. He talked of his work as something\naltogether apart from himself. There was nothing conceited or braggartly\nabout him.\n\n“I like it very much that you like my work,” he said. “But you haven’t\nseen it yet. To-morrow, if I get a good bull, I will try and show it to\nyou.”\n\nWhen he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bull-fight critic\nnor I would think he was boasting.\n\n“I am anxious to see it,” the critic said. “I would like to be\nconvinced.”\n\n“He doesn’t like my work much.” Romero turned to me. He was serious.\n\nThe critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had\nbeen incomplete.\n\n“Wait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out.”\n\n“Have you seen the bulls for to-morrow?” the critic asked me.\n\n“Yes. I saw them unloaded.”\n\nPedro Romero leaned forward.\n\n“What did you think of them?”\n\n“Very nice,” I said. “About twenty-six arrobas. Very short horns.\nHaven’t you seen them?”\n\n“Oh, yes,” said Romero.\n\n“They won’t weigh twenty-six arrobas,” said the critic.\n\n“No,” said Romero.\n\n“They’ve got bananas for horns,” the critic said.\n\n“You call them bananas?” asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled.\n“_You_ wouldn’t call them bananas?”\n\n“No,” I said. “They’re horns all right.”\n\n“They’re very short,” said Pedro Romero. “Very, very short. Still, they\naren’t bananas.”\n\n“I say, Jake,” Brett called from the next table, “you _have_ deserted\nus.”\n\n“Just temporarily,” I said. “We’re talking bulls.”\n\n“You _are_ superior.”\n\n“Tell him that bulls have no balls,” Mike shouted. He was drunk.\n\nRomero looked at me inquiringly.\n\n“Drunk,” I said. “Borracho! Muy borracho!”\n\n“You might introduce your friends,” Brett said. She had not stopped\nlooking at Pedro Romero. I asked them if they would like to have coffee\nwith us. They both stood up. Romero’s face was very brown. He had very\nnice manners."}
{"text": "I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was\nnot enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to\nhave coffee. Mike ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for\neverybody. There was a lot of drunken talking.\n\n“Tell him I think writing is lousy,” Bill said. “Go on, tell him. Tell\nhim I’m ashamed of being a writer.”\n\nPedro Romero was sitting beside Brett and listening to her.\n\n“Go on. Tell him!” Bill said.\n\nRomero looked up smiling.\n\n“This gentleman,” I said, “is a writer.”\n\nRomero was impressed. “This other one, too,” I said, pointing at Cohn.\n\n“He looks like Villalta,” Romero said, looking at Bill. “Rafael, doesn’t\nhe look like Villalta?”\n\n“I can’t see it,” the critic said.\n\n“Really,” Romero said in Spanish. “He looks a lot like Villalta. What\ndoes the drunken one do?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Is that why he drinks?”\n\n“No. He’s waiting to marry this lady.”\n\n“Tell him bulls have no balls!” Mike shouted, very drunk, from the other\nend of the table.\n\n“What does he say?”\n\n“He’s drunk.”\n\n“Jake,” Mike called. “Tell him bulls have no balls!”\n\n“You understand?” I said.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nI was sure he didn’t, so it was all right.\n\n“Tell him Brett wants to see him put on those green pants.”\n\n“Pipe down, Mike.”\n\n“Tell him Brett is dying to know how he can get into those pants.”\n\n“Pipe down.”\n\nDuring this Romero was fingering his glass and talking with Brett. Brett\nwas talking French and he was talking Spanish and a little English, and\nlaughing.\n\nBill was filling the glasses.\n\n“Tell him Brett wants to come into——”\n\n“Oh, pipe down, Mike, for Christ’s sake!”\n\nRomero looked up smiling. “Pipe down! I know that,” he said.\n\nJust then Montoya came into the room. He started to smile at me, then he\nsaw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting\nlaughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of\ndrunks. He did not even nod.\n\nMontoya went out of the room. Mike was on his feet proposing a toast.\n“Let’s all drink to—” he began. “Pedro Romero,” I said. Everybody stood\nup. Romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it\ndown, I rushing it a little because Mike was trying to make it clear\nthat that was not at all what he was going to drink to. But it went off\nall right, and Pedro Romero shook hands with every one and he and the\ncritic went out together.\n\n“My God! he’s a lovely boy,” Brett said. “And how I would love to see\nhim get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn.”\n\n“I started to tell him,” Mike began. “And Jake kept interrupting me. Why\ndo you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?”\n\n“Oh, shut up, Mike! Nobody interrupted you.”\n\n“No, I’d like to get this settled.” He turned away from me. “Do you\nthink you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among\nus? People who are out to have a good time? For God’s sake don’t be so\nnoisy, Cohn!”\n\n“Oh, cut it out, Mike,” Cohn said.\n\n“Do you think Brett wants you here? Do you think you add to the party?\nWhy don’t you say something?”\n\n“I said all I had to say the other night, Mike.”\n\n“I’m not one of you literary chaps.” Mike stood shakily and leaned\nagainst the table. “I’m not clever. But I do know when I’m not wanted.\nWhy don’t you see when you’re not wanted, Cohn? Go away. Go away, for\nGod’s sake. Take that sad Jewish face away. Don’t you think I’m right?”\n\nHe looked at us.\n\n“Sure,” I said. “Let’s all go over to the Iruña.”\n\n“No. Don’t you think I’m right? I love that woman.”\n\n“Oh, don’t start that again. Do shove it along, Michael,” Brett said.\n\n“Don’t you think I’m right, Jake?”\n\nCohn still sat at the table. His face had the sallow, yellow look it got\nwhen he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it. The\nchildish, drunken heroics of it. It was his affair with a lady of title.\n\n“Jake,” Mike said. He was almost crying. “You know I’m right. Listen,\nyou!” He turned to Cohn: “Go away! Go away now!”\n\n“But I won’t go, Mike,” said Cohn.\n\n“Then I’ll make you!” Mike started toward him around the table. Cohn\nstood up and took off his glasses. He stood waiting, his face sallow,\nhis hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready\nto do battle for his lady love."}
{"text": "I grabbed Mike. “Come on to the café,” I said. “You can’t hit him here\nin the hotel.”\n\n“Good!” said Mike. “Good idea!”\n\nWe started off. I looked back as Mike stumbled up the stairs and saw\nCohn putting his glasses on again. Bill was sitting at the table pouring\nanother glass of Fundador. Brett was sitting looking straight ahead at\nnothing.\n\nOutside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to\nget through the clouds. There was a wind blowing. The military band was\nplaying and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the\nfireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons. A\nballoon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind\nor blown against the houses of the square. Some fell into the crowd. The\nmagnesium flared and the fireworks exploded and chased about in the\ncrowd. There was no one dancing in the square. The gravel was too wet.\n\nBrett came out with Bill and joined us. We stood in the crowd and\nwatched Don Manuel Orquito, the fireworks king, standing on a little\nplatform, carefully starting the balloons with sticks, standing above\nthe heads of the crowd to launch the balloons off into the wind. The\nwind brought them all down, and Don Manuel Orquito’s face was sweaty in\nthe light of his complicated fireworks that fell into the crowd and\ncharged and chased, sputtering and cracking, between the legs of the\npeople. The people shouted as each new luminous paper bubble careened,\ncaught fire, and fell.\n\n“They’re razzing Don Manuel,” Bill said.\n\n“How do you know he’s Don Manuel?” Brett said.\n\n“His name’s on the programme. Don Manuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of\nesta ciudad.”\n\n“Globos illuminados,” Mike said. “A collection of globos illuminados.\nThat’s what the paper said.”\n\nThe wind blew the band music away.\n\n“I say, I wish one would go up,” Brett said. “That Don Manuel chap is\nfurious.”\n\n“He’s probably worked for weeks fixing them to go off, spelling out\n‘Hail to San Fermin,’” Bill said.\n\n“Globos illuminados,” Mike said. “A bunch of bloody globos illuminados.”\n\n“Come on,” said Brett. “We can’t stand here.”\n\n“Her ladyship wants a drink,” Mike said.\n\n“How you know things,” Brett said.\n\nInside, the café was crowded and very noisy. No one noticed us come in.\nWe could not find a table. There was a great noise going on.\n\n“Come on, let’s get out of here,” Bill said.\n\nOutside the paseo was going in under the arcade. There were some English\nand Americans from Biarritz in sport clothes scattered at the tables.\nSome of the women stared at the people going by with lorgnons. We had\nacquired, at some time, a friend of Bill’s from Biarritz. She was\nstaying with another girl at the Grand Hotel. The other girl had a\nheadache and had gone to bed.\n\n“Here’s the pub,” Mike said. It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar\nwhere you could get food and where they danced in the back room. We all\nsat down at a table and ordered a bottle of Fundador. The bar was not\nfull. There was nothing going on.\n\n“This is a hell of a place,” Bill said.\n\n“It’s too early.”\n\n“Let’s take the bottle and come back later,” Bill said. “I don’t want to\nsit here on a night like this.”\n\n“Let’s go and look at the English,” Mike said. “I love to look at the\nEnglish.”\n\n“They’re awful,” Bill said. “Where did they all come from?”\n\n“They come from Biarritz,” Mike said, “They come to see the last day of\nthe quaint little Spanish fiesta.”\n\n“I’ll festa them,” Bill said.\n\n“You’re an extraordinarily beautiful girl.” Mike turned to Bill’s\nfriend. “When did you come here?”\n\n“Come off it, Michael.”\n\n“I say, she _is_ a lovely girl. Where have I been? Where have I been\nlooking all this while? You’re a lovely thing. _Have_ we met? Come along\nwith me and Bill. We’re going to festa the English.”\n\n“I’ll festa them,” Bill said, “What the hell are they doing at this\nfiesta?”\n\n“Come on,” Mike said. “Just us three. We’re going to festa the bloody\nEnglish. I hope you’re not English? I’m Scotch. I hate the English. I’m\ngoing to festa them. Come on, Bill.”\n\nThrough the window we saw them, all three arm in arm, going toward the\ncafé. Rockets were going up in the square.\n\n“I’m going to sit here,” Brett said.\n\n“I’ll stay with you,” Cohn said."}
{"text": "“Oh, don’t!” Brett said. “For God’s sake, go off somewhere. Can’t you\nsee Jake and I want to talk?”\n\n“I didn’t,” Cohn said. “I thought I’d sit here because I felt a little\ntight.”\n\n“What a hell of a reason for sitting with any one. If you’re tight, go\nto bed. Go on to bed.”\n\n“Was I rude enough to him?” Brett asked. Cohn was gone. “My God! I’m so\nsick of him!”\n\n“He doesn’t add much to the gayety.”\n\n“He depresses me so.”\n\n“He’s behaved very badly.”\n\n“Damned badly. He had a chance to behave so well.”\n\n“He’s probably waiting just outside the door now.”\n\n“Yes. He would. You know I do know how he feels. He can’t believe it\ndidn’t mean anything.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“Nobody else would behave as badly. Oh, I’m so sick of the whole thing.\nAnd Michael. Michael’s been lovely, too.”\n\n“It’s been damned hard on Mike.”\n\n“Yes. But he didn’t need to be a swine.”\n\n“Everybody behaves badly,” I said. “Give them the proper chance.”\n\n“You wouldn’t behave badly.” Brett looked at me.\n\n“I’d be as big an ass as Cohn,” I said.\n\n“Darling, don’t let’s talk a lot of rot.”\n\n“All right. Talk about anything you like.”\n\n“Don’t be difficult. You’re the only person I’ve got, and I feel rather\nawful to-night.”\n\n“You’ve got Mike.”\n\n“Yes, Mike. Hasn’t he been pretty?”\n\n“Well,” I said, “it’s been damned hard on Mike, having Cohn around and\nseeing him with you.”\n\n“Don’t I know it, darling? Please don’t make me feel any worse than I\ndo.”\n\nBrett was nervous as I had never seen her before. She kept looking away\nfrom me and looking ahead at the wall.\n\n“Want to go for a walk?”\n\n“Yes. Come on.”\n\nI corked up the Fundador bottle and gave it to the bartender.\n\n“Let’s have one more drink of that,” Brett said. “My nerves are rotten.”\n\nWe each drank a glass of the smooth amontillado brandy.\n\n“Come on,” said Brett.\n\nAs we came out the door I saw Cohn walk out from under the arcade.\n\n“He _was_ there,” Brett said.\n\n“He can’t be away from you.”\n\n“Poor devil!”\n\n“I’m not sorry for him. I hate him, myself.”\n\n“I hate him, too,” she shivered. “I hate his damned suffering.”\n\nWe walked arm in arm down the side street away from the crowd and the\nlights of the square. The street was dark and wet, and we walked along\nit to the fortifications at the edge of town. We passed wine-shops with\nlight coming out from their doors onto the black, wet street, and sudden\nbursts of music.\n\n“Want to go in?”\n\n“No.”\n\nWe walked out across the wet grass and onto the stone wall of the\nfortifications. I spread a newspaper on the stone and Brett sat down.\nAcross the plain it was dark, and we could see the mountains. The wind\nwas high up and took the clouds across the moon. Below us were the dark\npits of the fortifications. Behind were the trees and the shadow of the\ncathedral, and the town silhouetted against the moon.\n\n“Don’t feel bad,” I said.\n\n“I feel like hell,” Brett said. “Don’t let’s talk.”\n\nWe looked out at the plain. The long lines of trees were dark in the\nmoonlight. There were the lights of a car on the road climbing the\nmountain. Up on the top of the mountain we saw the lights of the fort.\nBelow to the left was the river. It was high from the rain, and black\nand smooth. Trees were dark along the banks. We sat and looked out.\nBrett stared straight ahead. Suddenly she shivered.\n\n“It’s cold.”\n\n“Want to walk back?”\n\n“Through the park.”\n\nWe climbed down. It was clouding over again. In the park it was dark\nunder the trees.\n\n“Do you still love me, Jake?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\n“Because I’m a goner,” Brett said.\n\n“How?”\n\n“I’m a goner. I’m mad about the Romero boy. I’m in love with him, I\nthink.”\n\n“I wouldn’t be if I were you.”\n\n“I can’t help it. I’m a goner. It’s tearing me all up inside.”\n\n“Don’t do it.”\n\n“I can’t help it. I’ve never been able to help anything.”\n\n“You ought to stop it.”\n\n“How can I stop it? I can’t stop things. Feel that?”\n\nHer hand was trembling.\n\n“I’m like that all through.”\n\n“You oughtn’t to do it.”\n\n“I can’t help it. I’m a goner now, anyway. Don’t you see the\ndifference?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I’ve got to do something. I’ve got to do something I really want to do.\nI’ve lost my self-respect.”\n\n“You don’t have to do that.”\n\n“Oh, darling, don’t be difficult. What do you think it’s meant to have\nthat damned Jew about, and Mike the way he’s acted?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“I can’t just stay tight all the time.”\n\n“No.”"}
{"text": "“Oh, darling, please stay by me. Please stay by me and see me through\nthis.”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“I don’t say it’s right. It is right though for me. God knows, I’ve\nnever felt such a bitch.”\n\n“What do you want me to do?”\n\n“Come on,” Brett said. “Let’s go and find him.”\n\nTogether we walked down the gravel path in the park in the dark, under\nthe trees and then out from under the trees and past the gate into the\nstreet that led into town.\n\nPedro Romero was in the café. He was at a table with other bull-fighters\nand bull-fight critics. They were smoking cigars. When we came in they\nlooked up. Romero smiled and bowed. We sat down at a table half-way down\nthe room.\n\n“Ask him to come over and have a drink.”\n\n“Not yet. He’ll come over.”\n\n“I can’t look at him.”\n\n“He’s nice to look at,” I said.\n\n“I’ve always done just what I wanted.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“I do feel such a bitch.”\n\n“Well,” I said.\n\n“My God!” said Brett, “the things a woman goes through.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Oh, I do feel such a bitch.”\n\nI looked across at the table. Pedro Romero smiled. He said something to\nthe other people at his table, and stood up. He came over to our table.\nI stood up and we shook hands.\n\n“Won’t you have a drink?”\n\n“You must have a drink with me,” he said. He seated himself, asking\nBrett’s permission without saying anything. He had very nice manners.\nBut he kept on smoking his cigar. It went well with his face.\n\n“You like cigars?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, yes. I always smoke cigars.”\n\nIt was part of his system of authority. It made him seem older. I\nnoticed his skin. It was clear and smooth and very brown. There was a\ntriangular scar on his cheek-bone. I saw he was watching Brett. He felt\nthere was something between them. He must have felt it when Brett gave\nhim her hand. He was being very careful. I think he was sure, but he did\nnot want to make any mistake.\n\n“You fight to-morrow?” I said.\n\n“Yes,” he said. “Algabeno was hurt to-day in Madrid. Did you hear?”\n\n“No,” I said. “Badly?”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“Nothing. Here,” he showed his hand. Brett reached out and spread the\nfingers apart.\n\n“Oh!” he said in English, “you tell fortunes?”\n\n“Sometimes. Do you mind?”\n\n“No. I like it.” He spread his hand flat on the table. “Tell me I live\nfor always, and be a millionaire.”\n\nHe was still very polite, but he was surer of himself. “Look,” he said,\n“do you see any bulls in my hand?”\n\nHe laughed. His hand was very fine and the wrist was small.\n\n“There are thousands of bulls,” Brett said. She was not at all nervous\nnow. She looked lovely.\n\n“Good,” Romero laughed. “At a thousand duros apiece,” he said to me in\nSpanish. “Tell me some more.”\n\n“It’s a good hand,” Brett said. “I think he’ll live a long time.”\n\n“Say it to me. Not to your friend.”\n\n“I said you’d live a long time.”\n\n“I know it,” Romero said. “I’m never going to die.”\n\nI tapped with my finger-tips on the table. Romero saw it. He shook his\nhead.\n\n“No. Don’t do that. The bulls are my best friends.”\n\nI translated to Brett.\n\n“You kill your friends?” she asked.\n\n“Always,” he said in English, and laughed. “So they don’t kill me.” He\nlooked at her across the table.\n\n“You know English well.”\n\n“Yes,” he said. “Pretty well, sometimes. But I must not let anybody\nknow. It would be very bad, a torero who speaks English.”\n\n“Why?” asked Brett.\n\n“It would be bad. The people would not like it. Not yet.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“They would not like it. Bull-fighters are not like that.”\n\n“What are bull-fighters like?”\n\nHe laughed and tipped his hat down over his eyes and changed the angle\nof his cigar and the expression of his face.\n\n“Like at the table,” he said. I glanced over. He had mimicked exactly\nthe expression of Nacional. He smiled, his face natural again. “No. I\nmust forget English.”\n\n“Don’t forget it, yet,” Brett said.\n\n“No?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nHe laughed again.\n\n“I would like a hat like that,” Brett said.\n\n“Good. I’ll get you one.”\n\n“Right. See that you do.”\n\n“I will. I’ll get you one to-night.”\n\nI stood up. Romero rose, too.\n\n“Sit down,” I said. “I must go and find our friends and bring them\nhere.”\n\nHe looked at me. It was a final look to ask if it were understood. It\nwas understood all right.\n\n“Sit down,” Brett said to him. “You must teach me Spanish.”"}
{"text": "He sat down and looked at her across the table. I went out. The\nhard-eyed people at the bull-fighter table watched me go. It was not\npleasant. When I came back and looked in the café, twenty minutes later,\nBrett and Pedro Romero were gone. The coffee-glasses and our three empty\ncognac-glasses were on the table. A waiter came with a cloth and picked\nup the glasses and mopped off the table.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   17\n\nOutside the Bar Milano I found Bill and Mike and Edna. Edna was the\ngirl’s name.\n\n“We’ve been thrown out,” Edna said.\n\n“By the police,” said Mike. “There’s some people in there that don’t\nlike me.”\n\n“I’ve kept them out of four fights,” Edna said. “You’ve got to help me.”\n\nBill’s face was red.\n\n“Come back in, Edna,” he said. “Go on in there and dance with Mike.”\n\n“It’s silly,” Edna said. “There’ll just be another row.”\n\n“Damned Biarritz swine,” Bill said.\n\n“Come on,” Mike said. “After all, it’s a pub. They can’t occupy a whole\npub.”\n\n“Good old Mike,” Bill said. “Damned English swine come here and insult\nMike and try and spoil the fiesta.”\n\n“They’re so bloody,” Mike said. “I hate the English.”\n\n“They can’t insult Mike,” Bill said. “Mike is a swell fellow. They can’t\ninsult Mike. I won’t stand it. Who cares if he is a damn bankrupt?” His\nvoice broke.\n\n“Who cares?” Mike said. “I don’t care. Jake doesn’t care. Do _you_\ncare?”\n\n“No,” Edna said. “Are you a bankrupt?”\n\n“Of course I am. You don’t care, do you, Bill?”\n\nBill put his arm around Mike’s shoulder.\n\n“I wish to hell I was a bankrupt. I’d show those bastards.”\n\n“They’re just English,” Mike said. “It never makes any difference what\nthe English say.”\n\n“The dirty swine,” Bill said. “I’m going to clean them out.”\n\n“Bill,” Edna looked at me. “Please don’t go in again, Bill. They’re so\nstupid.”\n\n“That’s it,” said Mike. “They’re stupid. I knew that was what it was.”\n\n“They can’t say things like that about Mike,” Bill said.\n\n“Do you know them?” I asked Mike.\n\n“No. I never saw them. They say they know me.”\n\n“I won’t stand it,” Bill said.\n\n“Come on. Let’s go over to the Suizo,” I said.\n\n“They’re a bunch of Edna’s friends from Biarritz,” Bill said.\n\n“They’re simply stupid,” Edna said.\n\n“One of them’s Charley Blackman, from Chicago,” Bill said.\n\n“I was never in Chicago,” Mike said.\n\nEdna started to laugh and could not stop.\n\n“Take me away from here,” she said, “you bankrupts.”\n\n“What kind of a row was it?” I asked Edna. We were walking across the\nsquare to the Suizo. Bill was gone.\n\n“I don’t know what happened, but some one had the police called to keep\nMike out of the back room. There were some people that had known Mike at\nCannes. What’s the matter with Mike?”\n\n“Probably he owes them money” I said. “That’s what people usually get\nbitter about.”\n\nIn front of the ticket-booths out in the square there were two lines of\npeople waiting. They were sitting on chairs or crouched on the ground\nwith blankets and newspapers around them. They were waiting for the\nwickets to open in the morning to buy tickets for the bull-fight. The\nnight was clearing and the moon was out. Some of the people in the line\nwere sleeping.\n\nAt the Café Suizo we had just sat down and ordered Fundador when Robert\nCohn came up.\n\n“Where’s Brett?” he asked.\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“She was with you.”\n\n“She must have gone to bed.”\n\n“She’s not.”\n\n“I don’t know where she is.”\n\nHis face was sallow under the light. He was standing up.\n\n“Tell me where she is.”\n\n“Sit down,” I said. “I don’t know where she is.”\n\n“The hell you don’t!”\n\n“You can shut your face.”\n\n“Tell me where Brett is.”\n\n“I’ll not tell you a damn thing.”\n\n“You know where she is.”\n\n“If I did I wouldn’t tell you.”\n\n“Oh, go to hell, Cohn,” Mike called from the table. “Brett’s gone off\nwith the bull-fighter chap. They’re on their honeymoon.”\n\n“You shut up.”\n\n“Oh, go to hell!” Mike said languidly.\n\n“Is that where she is?” Cohn turned to me.\n\n“Go to hell!”\n\n“She was with you. Is that where she is?”\n\n“Go to hell!”\n\n“I’ll make you tell me”—he stepped forward—“you damned pimp.”"}
{"text": "I swung at him and he ducked. I saw his face duck sideways in the light.\nHe hit me and I sat down on the pavement. As I started to get on my feet\nhe hit me twice. I went down backward under a table. I tried to get up\nand felt I did not have any legs. I felt I must get on my feet and try\nand hit him. Mike helped me up. Some one poured a carafe of water on my\nhead. Mike had an arm around me, and I found I was sitting on a chair.\nMike was pulling at my ears.\n\n“I say, you were cold,” Mike said.\n\n“Where the hell were you?”\n\n“Oh, I was around.”\n\n“You didn’t want to mix in it?”\n\n“He knocked Mike down, too,” Edna said.\n\n“He didn’t knock me out,” Mike said. “I just lay there.”\n\n“Does this happen every night at your fiestas?” Edna asked. “Wasn’t that\nMr. Cohn?”\n\n“I’m all right,” I said. “My head’s a little wobbly.”\n\nThere were several waiters and a crowd of people standing around.\n\n“Vaya!” said Mike. “Get away. Go on.”\n\nThe waiters moved the people away.\n\n“It was quite a thing to watch,” Edna said. “He must be a boxer.”\n\n“He is.”\n\n“I wish Bill had been here,” Edna said. “I’d like to have seen Bill\nknocked down, too. I’ve always wanted to see Bill knocked down. He’s so\nbig.”\n\n“I was hoping he would knock down a waiter,” Mike said, “and get\narrested. I’d like to see Mr. Robert Cohn in jail.”\n\n“No,” I said.\n\n“Oh, no,” said Edna. “You don’t mean that.”\n\n“I do, though,” Mike said. “I’m not one of these chaps likes being\nknocked about. I never play games, even.”\n\nMike took a drink.\n\n“I never liked to hunt, you know. There was always the danger of having\na horse fall on you. How do you feel, Jake?”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“You’re nice,” Edna said to Mike. “Are you really a bankrupt?”\n\n“I’m a tremendous bankrupt,” Mike said. “I owe money to everybody. Don’t\nyou owe any money?”\n\n“Tons.”\n\n“I owe everybody money,” Mike said. “I borrowed a hundred pesetas from\nMontoya to-night.”\n\n“The hell you did,” I said.\n\n“I’ll pay it back,” Mike said. “I always pay everything back.”\n\n“That’s why you’re a bankrupt, isn’t it?” Edna said.\n\nI stood up. I had heard them talking from a long way away. It all seemed\nlike some bad play.\n\n“I’m going over to the hotel,” I said. Then I heard them talking about\nme.\n\n“Is he all right?” Edna asked.\n\n“We’d better walk with him.”\n\n“I’m all right,” I said. “Don’t come. I’ll see you all later.”\n\nI walked away from the café. They were sitting at the table. I looked\nback at them and at the empty tables. There was a waiter sitting at one\nof the tables with his head in his hands.\n\nWalking across the square to the hotel everything looked new and\nchanged. I had never seen the trees before. I had never seen the\nflagpoles before, nor the front of the theatre. It was all different. I\nfelt as I felt once coming home from an out-of-town football game. I was\ncarrying a suitcase with my football things in it, and I walked up the\nstreet from the station in the town I had lived in all my life and it\nwas all new. They were raking the lawns and burning leaves in the road,\nand I stopped for a long time and watched. It was all strange. Then I\nwent on, and my feet seemed to be a long way off, and everything seemed\nto come from a long way off, and I could hear my feet walking a great\ndistance away. I had been kicked in the head early in the game. It was\nlike that crossing the square. It was like that going up the stairs in\nthe hotel. Going up the stairs took a long time, and I had the feeling\nthat I was carrying my suitcase. There was a light in the room. Bill\ncame out and met me in the hall.\n\n“Say,” he said, “go up and see Cohn. He’s been in a jam, and he’s asking\nfor you.”\n\n“The hell with him.”\n\n“Go on. Go on up and see him.”\n\nI did not want to climb another flight of stairs.\n\n“What are you looking at me that way for?”\n\n“I’m not looking at you. Go on up and see Cohn. He’s in bad shape.”\n\n“You were drunk a little while ago,” I said.\n\n“I’m drunk now,” Bill said. “But you go up and see Cohn. He wants to see\nyou.”\n\n“All right,” I said. It was just a matter of climbing more stairs. I\nwent on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase. I walked down the\nhall to Cohn’s room. The door was shut and I knocked.\n\n“Who is it?”\n\n“Barnes.”\n\n“Come in, Jake.”"}
{"text": "I opened the door and went in, and set down my suitcase. There was no\nlight in the room. Cohn was lying, face down, on the bed in the dark.\n\n“Hello, Jake.”\n\n“Don’t call me Jake.”\n\nI stood by the door. It was just like this that I had come home. Now it\nwas a hot bath that I needed. A deep, hot bath, to lie back in.\n\n“Where’s the bathroom?” I asked.\n\nCohn was crying. There he was, face down on the bed, crying. He had on a\nwhite polo shirt, the kind he’d worn at Princeton.\n\n“I’m sorry, Jake. Please forgive me.”\n\n“Forgive you, hell.”\n\n“Please forgive me, Jake.”\n\nI did not say anything. I stood there by the door.\n\n“I was crazy. You must see how it was.”\n\n“Oh, that’s all right.”\n\n“I couldn’t stand it about Brett.”\n\n“You called me a pimp.”\n\nI did not care. I wanted a hot bath. I wanted a hot bath in deep water.\n\n“I know. Please don’t remember it. I was crazy.”\n\n“That’s all right.”\n\nHe was crying. His voice was funny. He lay there in his white shirt on\nthe bed in the dark. His polo shirt.\n\n“I’m going away in the morning.”\n\nHe was crying without making any noise.\n\n“I just couldn’t stand it about Brett. I’ve been through hell, Jake.\nIt’s been simply hell. When I met her down here Brett treated me as\nthough I were a perfect stranger. I just couldn’t stand it. We lived\ntogether at San Sebastian. I suppose you know it. I can’t stand it any\nmore.”\n\nHe lay there on the bed.\n\n“Well,” I said, “I’m going to take a bath.”\n\n“You were the only friend I had, and I loved Brett so.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “so long.”\n\n“I guess it isn’t any use,” he said. “I guess it isn’t any damn use.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Everything. Please say you forgive me, Jake.”\n\n“Sure,” I said. “It’s all right.”\n\n“I felt so terribly. I’ve been through such hell, Jake. Now everything’s\ngone. Everything.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “so long. I’ve got to go.”\n\nHe rolled over, sat on the edge of the bed, and then stood up.\n\n“So long, Jake,” he said. “You’ll shake hands, won’t you?”\n\n“Sure. Why not?”\n\nWe shook hands. In the dark I could not see his face very well.\n\n“Well,” I said, “see you in the morning.”\n\n“I’m going away in the morning.”\n\n“Oh, yes,” I said.\n\nI went out. Cohn was standing in the door of the room.\n\n“Are you all right, Jake?” he asked.\n\n“Oh, yes,” I said. “I’m all right.”\n\nI could not find the bathroom. After a while I found it. There was a\ndeep stone tub. I turned on the taps and the water would not run. I sat\ndown on the edge of the bath-tub. When I got up to go I found I had\ntaken off my shoes. I hunted for them and found them and carried them\ndown-stairs. I found my room and went inside and undressed and got into\nbed.\n\n*        *        *        *        *\n\nI woke with a headache and the noise of the bands going by in the\nstreet. I remembered I had promised to take Bill’s friend Edna to see\nthe bulls go through the street and into the ring. I dressed and went\ndown-stairs and out into the cold early morning. People were crossing\nthe square, hurrying toward the bull-ring. Across the square were the\ntwo lines of men in front of the ticket-booths. They were still waiting\nfor the tickets to go on sale at seven o’clock. I hurried across the\nstreet to the café. The waiter told me that my friends had been there\nand gone.\n\n“How many were they?”\n\n“Two gentlemen and a lady.”\n\nThat was all right. Bill and Mike were with Edna. She had been afraid\nlast night they would pass out. That was why I was to be sure to take\nher. I drank the coffee and hurried with the other people toward the\nbull-ring. I was not groggy now. There was only a bad headache.\nEverything looked sharp and clear, and the town smelt of the early\nmorning."}
{"text": "The stretch of ground from the edge of the town to the bull-ring was\nmuddy. There was a crowd all along the fence that led to the ring, and\nthe outside balconies and the top of the bull-ring were solid with\npeople. I heard the rocket and I knew I could not get into the ring in\ntime to see the bulls come in, so I shoved through the crowd to the\nfence. I was pushed close against the planks of the fence. Between the\ntwo fences of the runway the police were clearing the crowd along. They\nwalked or trotted on into the bull-ring. Then people commenced to come\nrunning. A drunk slipped and fell. Two policemen grabbed him and rushed\nhim over to the fence. The crowd were running fast now. There was a\ngreat shout from the crowd, and putting my head through between the\nboards I saw the bulls just coming out of the street into the long\nrunning pen. They were going fast and gaining on the crowd. Just then\nanother drunk started out from the fence with a blouse in his hands. He\nwanted to do capework with the bulls. The two policemen tore out,\ncollared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the\nfence and stood flattened out against the fence as the last of the crowd\nand the bulls went by. There were so many people running ahead of the\nbulls that the mass thickened and slowed up going through the gate into\nthe ring, and as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy,\nmuddy-sided, horns swinging, one shot ahead, caught a man in the running\ncrowd in the back and lifted him in the air. Both the man’s arms were by\nhis sides, his head went back as the horn went in, and the bull lifted\nhim and then dropped him. The bull picked another man running in front,\nbut the man disappeared into the crowd, and the crowd was through the\ngate and into the ring with the bulls behind them. The red door of the\nring went shut, the crowd on the outside balconies of the bull-ring were\npressing through to the inside, there was a shout, then another shout.\n\nThe man who had been gored lay face down in the trampled mud. People\nclimbed over the fence, and I could not see the man because the crowd\nwas so thick around him. From inside the ring came the shouts. Each\nshout meant a charge by some bull into the crowd. You could tell by the\ndegree of intensity in the shout how bad a thing it was that was\nhappening. Then the rocket went up that meant the steers had gotten the\nbulls out of the ring and into the corrals. I left the fence and started\nback toward the town.\n\nBack in the town I went to the café to have a second coffee and some\nbuttered toast. The waiters were sweeping out the café and mopping off\nthe tables. One came over and took my order.\n\n“Anything happen at the encierro?”\n\n“I didn’t see it all. One man was badly cogido.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Here.” I put one hand on the small of my back and the other on my\nchest, where it looked as though the horn must have come through. The\nwaiter nodded his head and swept the crumbs from the table with his\ncloth.\n\n“Badly cogido,” he said. “All for sport. All for pleasure.”\n\nHe went away and came back with the long-handled coffee and milk pots.\nHe poured the milk and coffee. It came out of the long spouts in two\nstreams into the big cup. The waiter nodded his head.\n\n“Badly cogido through the back,” he said. He put the pots down on the\ntable and sat down in the chair at the table. “A big horn wound. All for\nfun. Just for fun. What do you think of that?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“That’s it. All for fun. Fun, you understand.”\n\n“You’re not an aficionado?”\n\n“Me? What are bulls? Animals. Brute animals.” He stood up and put his\nhand on the small of his back. “Right through the back. A cornada right\nthrough the back. For fun—you understand.”\n\nHe shook his head and walked away, carrying the coffee-pots. Two men\nwere going by in the street. The waiter shouted to them. They were\ngrave-looking. One shook his head. “Muerto!” he called.\n\nThe waiter nodded his head. The two men went on. They were on some\nerrand. The waiter came over to my table.\n\n“You hear? Muerto. Dead. He’s dead. With a horn through him. All for\nmorning fun. Es muy flamenco.”\n\n“It’s bad.”"}
{"text": "“Not for me,” the waiter said. “No fun in that for me.”\n\nLater in the day we learned that the man who was killed was named\nVicente Girones, and came from near Tafalla. The next day in the paper\nwe read that he was twenty-eight years old, and had a farm, a wife, and\ntwo children. He had continued to come to the fiesta each year after he\nwas married. The next day his wife came in from Tafalla to be with the\nbody, and the day after there was a service in the chapel of San Fermin,\nand the coffin was carried to the railway-station by members of the\ndancing and drinking society of Tafalla. The drums marched ahead, and\nthere was music on the fifes, and behind the men who carried the coffin\nwalked the wife and two children. . . . Behind them marched all the\nmembers of the dancing and drinking societies of Pamplona, Estella,\nTafalla, and Sanguesa who could stay over for the funeral. The coffin\nwas loaded into the baggage-car of the train, and the widow and the two\nchildren rode, sitting, all three together, in an open third-class\nrailway-carriage. The train started with a jerk, and then ran smoothly,\ngoing down grade around the edge of the plateau and out into the fields\nof grain that blew in the wind on the plain on the way to Tafalla.\n\nThe bull who killed Vicente Girones was named Bocanegra, was Number 118\nof the bull-breeding establishment of Sanchez Tabemo, and was killed by\nPedro Romero as the third bull of that same afternoon. His ear was cut\nby popular acclamation and given to Pedro Romero, who, in turn, gave it\nto Brett, who wrapped it in a handkerchief belonging to myself, and left\nboth ear and handkerchief, along with a number of Muratti\ncigarette-stubs, shoved far back in the drawer of the bed-table that\nstood beside her bed in the Hotel Montoya, in Pamplona.\n\n*        *        *        *        *\n\nBack in the hotel, the night watchman was sitting on a bench inside the\ndoor. He had been there all night and was very sleepy. He stood up as I\ncame in. Three of the waitresses came in at the same time. They had been\nto the morning show at the bull-ring. They went up-stairs laughing. I\nfollowed them up-stairs and went into my room. I took off my shoes and\nlay down on the bed. The window was open onto the balcony and the\nsunlight was bright in the room. I did not feel sleepy. It must have\nbeen half past three o’clock when I had gone to bed and the bands had\nwaked me at six. My jaw was sore on both sides. I felt it with my thumb\nand fingers. That damn Cohn. He should have hit somebody the first time\nhe was insulted, and then gone away. He was so sure that Brett loved\nhim. He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all. Some one\nknocked on the door.\n\n“Come in.”\n\nIt was Bill and Mike. They sat down on the bed.\n\n“Some encierro,” Bill said. “Some encierro.”\n\n“I say, weren’t you there?” Mike asked. “Ring for some beer, Bill.”\n\n“What a morning!” Bill said. He mopped off his face. “My God! what a\nmorning! And here’s old Jake. Old Jake, the human punching-bag.”\n\n“What happened inside?”\n\n“Good God!” Bill said, “what happened, Mike?”\n\n“There were these bulls coming in,” Mike said. “Just ahead of them was\nthe crowd, and some chap tripped and brought the whole lot of them\ndown.”\n\n“And the bulls all came in right over them,” Bill said.\n\n“I heard them yell.”\n\n“That was Edna,” Bill said.\n\n“Chaps kept coming out and waving their shirts.”\n\n“One bull went along the barrera and hooked everybody over.”\n\n“They took about twenty chaps to the infirmary,” Mike said.\n\n“What a morning!” Bill said. “The damn police kept arresting chaps that\nwanted to go and commit suicide with the bulls.”\n\n“The steers took them in, in the end,” Mike said.\n\n“It took about an hour.”\n\n“It was really about a quarter of an hour,” Mike objected.\n\n“Oh, go to hell,” Bill said. “You’ve been in the war. It was two hours\nand a half for me.”\n\n“Where’s that beer?” Mike asked.\n\n“What did you do with the lovely Edna?”\n\n“We took her home just now. She’s gone to bed.”\n\n“How did she like it?”\n\n“Fine. We told her it was just like that every morning.”\n\n“She was impressed,” Mike said.\n\n“She wanted us to go down in the ring, too,” Bill said. “She likes\naction.”"}
{"text": "“I said it wouldn’t be fair to my creditors,” Mike said.\n\n“What a morning,” Bill said. “And what a night!”\n\n“How’s your jaw, Jake?” Mike asked.\n\n“Sore,” I said.\n\nBill laughed.\n\n“Why didn’t you hit him with a chair?”\n\n“You can talk,” Mike said. “He’d have knocked you out, too. I never saw\nhim hit me. I rather think I saw him just before, and then quite\nsuddenly I was sitting down in the street, and Jake was lying under a\ntable.”\n\n“Where did he go afterward?” I asked.\n\n“Here she is,” Mike said. “Here’s the beautiful lady with the beer.”\n\nThe chambermaid put the tray with the beer-bottles and glasses down on\nthe table.\n\n“Now bring up three more bottles,” Mike said.\n\n“Where did Cohn go after he hit me?” I asked Bill.\n\n“Don’t you know about that?” Mike was opening a beer-bottle. He poured\nthe beer into one of the glasses, holding the glass close to the bottle.\n\n“Really?” Bill asked.\n\n“Why he went in and found Brett and the bull-fighter chap in the\nbull-fighter’s room, and then he massacred the poor, bloody\nbull-fighter.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What a night!” Bill said.\n\n“He nearly killed the poor, bloody bull-fighter. Then Cohn wanted to\ntake Brett away. Wanted to make an honest woman of her, I imagine.\nDamned touching scene.”\n\nHe took a long drink of the beer.\n\n“He is an ass.”\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“Brett gave him what for. She told him off. I think she was rather\ngood.”\n\n“I’ll bet she was,” Bill said.\n\n“Then Cohn broke down and cried, and wanted to shake hands with the\nbull-fighter fellow. He wanted to shake hands with Brett, too.”\n\n“I know. He shook hands with me.”\n\n“Did he? Well, they weren’t having any of it. The bull-fighter fellow\nwas rather good. He didn’t say much, but he kept getting up and getting\nknocked down again. Cohn couldn’t knock him out. It must have been\ndamned funny.”\n\n“Where did you hear all this?”\n\n“Brett. I saw her this morning.”\n\n“What happened finally?”\n\n“It seems the bull-fighter fellow was sitting on the bed. He’d been\nknocked down about fifteen times, and he wanted to fight some more.\nBrett held him and wouldn’t let him get up. He was weak, but Brett\ncouldn’t hold him, and he got up. Then Cohn said he wouldn’t hit him\nagain. Said he couldn’t do it. Said it would be wicked. So the\nbull-fighter chap sort of rather staggered over to him. Cohn went back\nagainst the wall.\n\n“‘So you won’t hit me?’\n\n“‘No,’ said Cohn. ‘I’d be ashamed to.’\n\n“So the bull-fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the\nface, and then sat down on the floor. He couldn’t get up, Brett said.\nCohn wanted to pick him up and carry him to the bed. He said if Cohn\nhelped him he’d kill him, and he’d kill him anyway this morning if Cohn\nwasn’t out of town. Cohn was crying, and Brett had told him off, and he\nwanted to shake hands. I’ve told you that before.”\n\n“Tell the rest,” Bill said.\n\n“It seems the bull-fighter chap was sitting on the floor. He was waiting\nto get strength enough to get up and hit Cohn again. Brett wasn’t having\nany shaking hands, and Cohn was crying and telling her how much he loved\nher, and she was telling him not to be a ruddy ass. Then Cohn leaned\ndown to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. No hard feelings, you\nknow. All for forgiveness. And the bull-fighter chap hit him in the face\nagain.”\n\n“That’s quite a kid,” Bill said.\n\n“He ruined Cohn,” Mike said. “You know I don’t think Cohn will ever want\nto knock people about again.”\n\n“When did you see Brett?”\n\n“This morning. She came in to get some things. She’s looking after this\nRomero lad.”\n\nHe poured out another bottle of beer.\n\n“Brett’s rather cut up. But she loves looking after people. That’s how\nwe came to go off together. She was looking after me.”\n\n“I know,” I said.\n\n“I’m rather drunk,” Mike said. “I think I’ll _stay_ rather drunk. This\nis all awfully amusing, but it’s not too pleasant. It’s not too pleasant\nfor me.”\n\nHe drank off the beer.\n\n“I gave Brett what for, you know. I said if she would go about with Jews\nand bull-fighters and such people, she must expect trouble.” He leaned\nforward. “I say, Jake, do you mind if I drink that bottle of yours?\nShe’ll bring you another one.”\n\n“Please,” I said. “I wasn’t drinking it, anyway.”"}
{"text": "Mike started to open the bottle. “Would you mind opening it?” I pressed\nup the wire fastener and poured it for him.\n\n“You know,” Mike went on, “Brett was rather good. She’s always rather\ngood. I gave her a fearful hiding about Jews and bull-fighters, and all\nthose sort of people, and do you know what she said: ‘Yes. I’ve had such\na hell of a happy life with the British aristocracy!’”\n\nHe took a drink.\n\n“That was rather good. Ashley, chap she got the title from, was a\nsailor, you know. Ninth baronet. When he came home he wouldn’t sleep in\na bed. Always made Brett sleep on the floor. Finally, when he got really\nbad, he used to tell her he’d kill her. Always slept with a loaded\nservice revolver. Brett used to take the shells out when he’d gone to\nsleep. She hasn’t had an absolutely happy life. Brett. Damned shame,\ntoo. She enjoys things so.”\n\nHe stood up. His hand was shaky.\n\n“I’m going in the room. Try and get a little sleep.”\n\nHe smiled.\n\n“We go too long without sleep in these fiestas. I’m going to start now\nand get plenty of sleep. Damn bad thing not to get sleep. Makes you\nfrightfully nervy.”\n\n“We’ll see you at noon at the Iruña,” Bill said.\n\nMike went out the door. We heard him in the next room.\n\nHe rang the bell and the chambermaid came and knocked at the door.\n\n“Bring up half a dozen bottles of beer and a bottle of Fundador,” Mike\ntold her.\n\n“Si, Señorito.”\n\n“I’m going to bed,” Bill said. “Poor old Mike. I had a hell of a row\nabout him last night.”\n\n“Where? At that Milano place?”\n\n“Yes. There was a fellow there that had helped pay Brett and Mike out of\nCannes, once. He was damned nasty.”\n\n“I know the story.”\n\n“I didn’t. Nobody ought to have a right to say things about Mike.”\n\n“That’s what makes it bad.”\n\n“They oughtn’t to have any right. I wish to hell they didn’t have any\nright. I’m going to bed.”\n\n“Was anybody killed in the ring?”\n\n“I don’t think so. Just badly hurt.”\n\n“A man was killed outside in the runway.”\n\n“Was there?” said Bill.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   18\n\nAt noon we were all at the café. It was crowded. We were eating shrimps\nand drinking beer. The town was crowded. Every street was full. Big\nmotor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking\naround the square. They brought people for the bull-fight. Sight-seeing\ncars came up, too. There was one with twenty-five Englishwomen in it.\nThey sat in the big, white car and looked through their glasses at the\nfiesta. The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the\nfiesta.\n\nThe fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars\nmade little islands of onlookers. When the cars emptied, the onlookers\nwere absorbed into the crowd. You did not see them again except as sport\nclothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in\nblack smocks. The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you\ndid not see them unless you passed close to a table. All the time there\nwas music in the street. The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were\ngoing. Inside the cafés men with their hands gripping the table, or on\neach other’s shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing.\n\n“Here comes Brett,” Bill said.\n\nI looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking,\nher head up, as though the fiesta were being staged in her honor, and\nshe found it pleasant and amusing.\n\n“Hello, you chaps!” she said. “I say, I _have_ a thirst.”\n\n“Get another big beer,” Bill said to the waiter.\n\n“Shrimps?”\n\n“Is Cohn gone?” Brett asked.\n\n“Yes,” Bill said. “He hired a car.”\n\nThe beer came. Brett started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook.\nShe saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip.\n\n“Good beer.”\n\n“Very good,” I said. I was nervous about Mike. I did not think he had\nslept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be\nunder control.\n\n“I heard Cohn had hurt you, Jake,” Brett said.\n\n“No. Knocked me out. That was all.”\n\n“I say, he did hurt Pedro Romero,” Brett said. “He hurt him most badly.”\n\n“How is he?”\n\n“He’ll be all right. He won’t go out of the room.”\n\n“Does he look badly?”\n\n“Very. He was really hurt. I told him I wanted to pop out and see you\nchaps for a minute.”\n\n“Is he going to fight?”"}
{"text": "“Rather. I’m going with you, if you don’t mind.”\n\n“How’s your boy friend?” Mike asked. He had not listened to anything\nthat Brett had said.\n\n“Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” he said. “She had a Jew named Cohn, but he\nturned out badly.”\n\nBrett stood up.\n\n“I am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you, Michael.”\n\n“How’s your boy friend?”\n\n“Damned well,” Brett said. “Watch him this afternoon.”\n\n“Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” Mike said. “A beautiful, bloody\nbull-fighter.”\n\n“Would you mind walking over with me? I want to talk to you, Jake.”\n\n“Tell him all about your bull-fighter,” Mike said. “Oh, to hell with\nyour bull-fighter!” He tipped the table so that all the beers and the\ndish of shrimps went over in a crash.\n\n“Come on,” Brett said. “Let’s get out of this.”\n\nIn the crowd crossing the square I said: “How is it?”\n\n“I’m not going to see him after lunch until the fight. His people come\nin and dress him. They’re very angry about me, he says.”\n\nBrett was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was\nbright.\n\n“I feel altogether changed,” Brett said. “You’ve no idea, Jake.”\n\n“Anything you want me to do?”\n\n“No, just go to the fight with me.”\n\n“We’ll see you at lunch?”\n\n“No. I’m eating with him.”\n\nWe were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel. They were\ncarrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade.\n\n“Want to take a turn out to the park?” Brett asked. “I don’t want to go\nup yet. I fancy he’s sleeping.”\n\nWe walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through\nthe barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of\nbooths. We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate.\nWe could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed\npeople. They were making the turn at the upper end of the park.\n\n“Don’t let’s go there,” Brett said. “I don’t want staring at just now.”\n\nWe stood in the sunlight. It was hot and good after the rain and the\nclouds from the sea.\n\n“I hope the wind goes down,” Brett said. “It’s very bad for him.”\n\n“So do I.”\n\n“He says the bulls are all right.”\n\n“They’re good.”\n\n“Is that San Fermin’s?”\n\nBrett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel.\n\n“Yes. Where the show started on Sunday.”\n\n“Let’s go in. Do you mind? I’d rather like to pray a little for him or\nsomething.”\n\nWe went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly. It\nwas dark inside. Many people were praying. You saw them as your eyes\nadjusted themselves to the half-light. We knelt at one of the long\nwooden benches. After a little I felt Brett stiffen beside me, and saw\nshe was looking straight ahead.\n\n“Come on,” she whispered throatily. “Let’s get out of here. Makes me\ndamned nervous.”\n\nOutside in the hot brightness of the street Brett looked up at the\ntree-tops in the wind. The praying had not been much of a success.\n\n“Don’t know why I get so nervy in church,” Brett said. “Never does me\nany good.”\n\nWe walked along.\n\n“I’m damned bad for a religious atmosphere,” Brett said. “I’ve the wrong\ntype of face.\n\n“You know,” Brett said, “I’m not worried about him at all. I just feel\nhappy about him.”\n\n“Good.”\n\n“I wish the wind would drop, though.”\n\n“It’s liable to go down by five o’clock.”\n\n“Let’s hope.”\n\n“You might pray,” I laughed.\n\n“Never does me any good. I’ve never gotten anything I prayed for. Have\nyou?”\n\n“Oh, yes.”\n\n“Oh, rot,” said Brett. “Maybe it works for some people, though. You\ndon’t look very religious, Jake.”\n\n“I’m pretty religious.”\n\n“Oh, rot,” said Brett. “Don’t start proselyting to-day. To-day’s going\nto be bad enough as it is.”\n\nIt was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way\nsince before she went off with Cohn. We were back again in front of the\nhotel. All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with\npeople eating.\n\n“Do look after Mike,” Brett said. “Don’t let him get too bad.”\n\n“Your frients haff gone up-stairs,” the German maître d’hôtel said in\nEnglish. He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him:\n\n“Thank you, so much. Have you anything else to say?”\n\n“No, _ma’am_.”\n\n“Good,” said Brett.\n\n“Save us a table for three,” I said to the German. He smiled his dirty\nlittle pink-and-white smile.\n\n“Iss madam eating here?”\n\n“No,” Brett said.\n\n“Den I think a tabul for two will be enuff.”"}
{"text": "“Don’t talk to him,” Brett said. “Mike must have been in bad shape,” she\nsaid on the stairs. We passed Montoya on the stairs. He bowed and did\nnot smile.\n\n“I’ll see you at the café,” Brett said. “Thank you, so much, Jake.”\n\nWe had stopped at the floor our rooms were on. She went straight down\nthe hall and into Romero’s room. She did not knock. She simply opened\nthe door, went in, and closed it behind her.\n\nI stood in front of the door of Mike’s room and knocked. There was no\nanswer. I tried the knob and it opened. Inside the room was in great\ndisorder. All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around. There\nwere empty bottles beside the bed. Mike lay on the bed looking like a\ndeath mask of himself. He opened his eyes and looked at me.\n\n“Hello, Jake,” he said very slowly. “I’m getting a lit tle sleep. I’ve\nwant ed a lit tle sleep for a long time.”\n\n“Let me cover you over.”\n\n“No. I’m quite warm.”\n\n“Don’t go. I have n’t got ten to sleep yet.”\n\n“You’ll sleep, Mike. Don’t worry, boy.”\n\n“Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” Mike said. “But her Jew has gone away.”\n\nHe turned his head and looked at me.\n\n“Damned good thing, what?”\n\n“Yes. Now go to sleep, Mike. You ought to get some sleep.”\n\n“I’m just start ing. I’m go ing to get a lit tle sleep.”\n\nHe shut his eyes. I went out of the room and turned the door to quietly.\nBill was in my room reading the paper.\n\n“See Mike?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Let’s go and eat.”\n\n“I won’t eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. He was damned\nsnotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs.”\n\n“He was snotty to us, too.”\n\n“Let’s go out and eat in the town.”\n\nWe went down the stairs. On the stairs we passed a girl coming up with a\ncovered tray.\n\n“There goes Brett’s lunch,” Bill said.\n\n“And the kid’s,” I said.\n\nOutside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up.\nHis red cheeks were shiny. He was being polite.\n\n“I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen,” he said.\n\n“Go sit at it,” Bill said. We went on out across the street.\n\nWe ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square. They were all\nmen eating in the restaurant. It was full of smoke and drinking and\nsinging. The food was good and so was the wine. We did not talk much.\nAfterward we went to the café and watched the fiesta come to the\nboiling-point. Brett came over soon after lunch. She said she had looked\nin the room and that Mike was asleep.\n\nWhen the fiesta boiled over and toward the bull-ring we went with the\ncrowd. Brett sat at the ringside between Bill and me. Directly below us\nwas the callejon, the passageway between the stands and the red fence of\nthe barrera. Behind us the concrete stands filled solidly. Out in front,\nbeyond the red fence, the sand of the ring was smooth-rolled and yellow.\nIt looked a little heavy from the rain, but it was dry in the sun and\nfirm and smooth. The sword-handlers and bull-ring servants came down the\ncallejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting\ncapes and muletas. They were bloodstained and compactly folded and\npacked in the baskets. The sword-handlers opened the heavy leather\nsword-cases so the red wrapped hilts of the sheaf of swords showed as\nthe leather case leaned against the fence. They unfolded the\ndark-stained red flannel of the muletas and fixed batons in them to\nspread the stuff and give the matador something to hold. Brett watched\nit all. She was absorbed in the professional details.\n\n“He’s his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas,” she said. “Why\ndo they call them muletas?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“I wonder if they ever launder them.”\n\n“I don’t think so. It might spoil the color.”\n\n“The blood must stiffen them,” Bill said.\n\n“Funny,” Brett said. “How one doesn’t mind the blood.”\n\nBelow in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged\neverything. All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full.\nThere was not an empty seat except in the President’s box. When he came\nin the fight would start. Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway\nthat led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms\nfurled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in\nacross the arena. Brett was watching them with the glasses.\n\n“Here, would you like to look?”"}
{"text": "I looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors. Romero was in\nthe centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right. Back of them\nwere their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway\nand in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors. Romero was\nwearing a black suit. His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes. I\ncould not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly\nmarked. He was looking straight ahead. Marcial was smoking a cigarette\nguardedly, holding it in his hand. Belmonte looked ahead, his face wan\nand yellow, his long wolf jaw out. He was looking at nothing. Neither he\nnor Romero seemed to have anything in common with the others. They were\nall alone. The President came in; there was handclapping above us in the\ngrand stand, and I handed the glasses to Brett. There was applause. The\nmusic started. Brett looked through the glasses.\n\n“Here, take them,” she said.\n\nThrough the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero. Marcial straightened\nup and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads\nback, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out. Behind\nthem came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the\ncapes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the\npicadors, their pics rising like lances. Behind all came the two trains\nof mules and the bull-ring servants. The matadors bowed, holding their\nhats on, before the President’s box, and then came over to the barrera\nbelow us. Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed\nit over the fence to his sword-handler. He said something to the\nsword-handler. Close below us we saw Romero’s lips were puffed, both\neyes were discolored. His face was discolored and swollen. The\nsword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and\nhanded up the cape.\n\n“Spread it out in front of you,” I said.\n\nBrett leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold.\nThe sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something. A man\nbeside me leaned over toward Brett.\n\n“He doesn’t want you to spread it,” he said. “You should fold it and\nkeep it in your lap.”\n\nBrett folded the heavy cape.\n\nRomero did not look up at us. He was speaking to Belmonte. Belmonte had\nsent his formal cape over to some friends. He looked across at them and\nsmiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth. Romero leaned over\nthe barrera and asked for the water-jug. The sword-handler brought it\nand Romero poured water over the percale of his fighting-cape, and then\nscuffed the lower folds in the sand with his slippered foot.\n\n“What’s that for?” Brett asked.\n\n“To give it weight in the wind.”\n\n“His face looks bad,” Bill said.\n\n“He feels very badly,” Brett said. “He should be in bed.”\n\nThe first bull was Belmonte’s. Belmonte was very good. But because he\ngot thirty thousand pesetas and people had stayed in line all night to\nbuy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than\nvery good. Belmonte’s great attraction is working close to the bull. In\nbull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of\nthe bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he\nis comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull\nhe is in great danger. Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the\nterrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy.\nPeople went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic\nsensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte. Fifteen years ago\nthey said if you wanted to see Belmonte you should go quickly, while he\nwas still alive. Since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls.\nWhen he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been,\nand when he came out of retirement the public were disappointed because\nno real man could work as close to the bulls as Belmonte was supposed to\nhave done, not, of course, even Belmonte."}
{"text": "Also Belmonte imposed conditions and insisted that his bulls should not\nbe too large, nor too dangerously armed with horns, and so the element\nthat was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there, and\nthe public, who wanted three times as much from Belmonte, who was sick\nwith a fistula, as Belmonte had ever been able to give, felt defrauded\nand cheated, and Belmonte’s jaw came further out in contempt, and his\nface turned yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pain\nincreased, and finally the crowd were actively against him, and he was\nutterly contemptuous and indifferent. He had meant to have a great\nafternoon, and instead it was an afternoon of sneers, shouted insults,\nand finally a volley of cushions and pieces of bread and vegetables,\nthrown down at him in the plaza where he had had his greatest triumphs.\nHis jaw only went further out. Sometimes he turned to smile that\ntoothed, long-jawed, lipless smile when he was called something\nparticularly insulting, and always the pain that any movement produced\ngrew stronger and stronger, until finally his yellow face was parchment\ncolor, and after his second bull was dead and the throwing of bread and\ncushions was over, after he had saluted the President with the same\nwolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the\nbarrera to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into\nthe callejon and leaned on the barrera below us, his head on his arms,\nnot seeing, not hearing anything, only going through his pain. When he\nlooked up, finally, he asked for a drink of water. He swallowed a\nlittle, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back\ninto the ring.\n\nBecause they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero. From the\nmoment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him.\nBelmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to. He\npaid no attention to Marcial. Marcial was the sort of thing he knew all\nabout. He had come out of retirement to compete with Marcial, knowing it\nwas a competition gained in advance. He had expected to compete with\nMarcial and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he\nknew that the sincerity of his own bull-fighting would be so set off by\nthe false æsthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he\nwould only have to be in the ring. His return from retirement had been\nspoiled by Romero. Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully,\nwhat he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes. The\ncrowd felt it, even the people from Biarritz, even the American\nambassador saw it, finally. It was a competition that Belmonte would not\nenter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death. Belmonte\nwas no longer well enough. He no longer had his greatest moments in the\nbull-ring. He was not sure that there were any great moments. Things\nwere not the same and now life only came in flashes. He had flashes of\nthe old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he\nhad discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for\ntheir safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence, looking\nover at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder. So he had\ntwo small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the\ngreatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was\nalways with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did\nnot give him a good feeling. It was the greatness, but it did not make\nbull-fighting wonderful to him any more."}
{"text": "Pedro Romero had the greatness. He loved bull-fighting, and I think he\nloved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett. Everything of which he\ncould control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon.\nNever once did he look up. He made it stronger that way, and did it for\nhimself, too, as well as for her. Because he did not look up to ask if\nit pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him,\nand yet he did it for her, too. But he did not do it for her at any loss\nto himself. He gained by it all through the afternoon.\n\nHis first “quite” was directly below us. The three matadors take the\nbull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. Belmonte was the\nfirst. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. The three of them were\nstanding at the left of the horse. The picador, his hat down over his\neyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in\nthe spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the\nhorse forward toward the bull. The bull was watching. Seemingly he\nwatched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel\npoint of the pic. Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head.\nHe did not want to charge. Romero flicked his cape so the color caught\nthe bull’s eye. The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not\nthe flash of color but a white horse, and a man leaned far over the\nhorse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of\nmuscle on the bull’s shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he\npivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull’s\nshoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.\n\nThe bull did not insist under the iron. He did not really want to get at\nthe horse. He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him\nout with his cape. He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped\nand, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. The\nbull’s tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of\nthe bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. The dampened, mud-weighted cape\nswung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just\nahead of the bull. At the end of the pass they were facing each other\nagain. Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero’s cape filled\nagain, this time on the other side. Each time he let the bull pass so\nclose that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted\nahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass. It was all so slow\nand so controlled. It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep.\nHe made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that\nturned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand\non his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going\naway.\n\nIn his own bulls he was perfect. His first bull did not see well. After\nthe first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the\nvision was impaired. He worked accordingly. It was not brilliant\nbull-fighting. It was only perfect bull-fighting. The crowd wanted the\nbull changed. They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with\na bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order\nhim replaced.\n\n“Why don’t they change him?” Brett asked.\n\n“They’ve paid for him. They don’t want to lose their money.”\n\n“It’s hardly fair to Romero.”\n\n“Watch how he handles a bull that can’t see the color.”\n\n“It’s the sort of thing I don’t like to see.”"}
{"text": "It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was\ndoing it. With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or\nthe scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent\nwith his body. He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and\nwould start for it, and then shift the bull’s charge to the flannel and\nfinish out the pass in the classic manner. The Biarritz crowd did not\nlike it They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that\nlittle sidestep each time as he transferred the bull’s charge from his\nown body to the flannel. They preferred Belmonte’s imitation of himself\nor Marcial’s imitation of Belmonte. There were three of them in the row\nbehind us.\n\n“What’s he afraid of the bull for? The bull’s so dumb he only goes after\nthe cloth.”\n\n“He’s just a young bull-fighter. He hasn’t learned it yet.”\n\n“But I thought he was fine with the cape before.”\n\n“Probably he’s nervous now.”\n\nOut in the centre of the ring, all alone, Romero was going on with the\nsame thing, getting so close that the bull could see him plainly,\noffering the body, offering it again a little closer, the bull watching\ndully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again\nand finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came,\ngiving the bull the red cloth to follow with at little, almost\nimperceptible, jerk that so offended the critical judgment of the\nBiarritz bull-fight experts.\n\n“He’s going to kill now,” I said to Brett. “The bull’s still strong. He\nwouldn’t wear himself out.”\n\nOut in the centre of the ring Romero profiled in front of the bull, drew\nthe sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and\nsighted along the blade. The bull charged as Romero charged. Romero’s\nleft hand dropped the muleta over the bull’s muzzle to blind him, his\nleft shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and\nfor just an instant he and the bull were one, Romero way out over the\nbull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had\ngone in between the bull’s shoulders. Then the figure was broken. There\nwas a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one\nhand up, facing the bull, his shirt ripped out from under his sleeve,\nthe white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilt tight\nbetween his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling.\n\n“There he goes,” Bill said.\n\nRomero was close enough so the bull could see him. His hand still up, he\nspoke to the bull. The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward\nand he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air.\n\nThey handed the sword to Romero, and carrying it blade down, the muleta\nin his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President’s box,\nbowed, straightened, and came over to the barrera and handed over the\nsword and muleta.\n\n“Bad one,” said the sword-handler.\n\n“He made me sweat,” said Romero. He wiped off his face. The\nsword-handler handed him the water-jug. Romero wiped his lips. It hurt\nhim to drink out of the jug. He did not look up at us.\n\nMarcial had a big day. They were still applauding him when Romero’s last\nbull came in. It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man\nin the morning running.\n\nDuring Romero’s first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable.\nEverything he did showed it. All the concentration of the awkwardly\ndelicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out.\nThe fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been\nsmashed and his body hurt. He was wiping all that out now. Each thing\nthat he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner. It was a\ngood bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged\neasily and surely. He was what Romero wanted in bulls."}
{"text": "When he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the\ncrowd made him go on. They did not want the bull killed yet, they did\nnot want it to be over. Romero went on. It was like a course in\nbull-fighting. All the passes he linked up, all completed, all slow,\ntempled and smooth. There were no tricks and no mystifications. There\nwas no brusqueness. And each pass as it reached the summit gave you a\nsudden ache inside. The crowd did not want it ever to be finished.\n\nThe bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed\ndirectly below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last\nbull, but as he wanted to. He profiled directly in front of the bull,\ndrew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the\nblade. The bull watched him. Romero spoke to the bull and tapped one of\nhis feet. The bull charged and Romero waited for the charge, the muleta\nheld low, sighting along the blade, his feet firm. Then without taking a\nstep forward, he became one with the bull, the sword was in high between\nthe shoulders, the bull had followed the low-swung flannel, that\ndisappeared as Romero lurched clear to the left, and it was over. The\nbull tried to go forward, his legs commenced to settle, he swung from\nside to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees, and Romero’s older\nbrother leaned forward behind him and drove a short knife into the\nbull’s neck at the base of the horns. The first time he missed. He drove\nthe knife in again, and the bull went over, twitching and rigid.\nRomero’s brother, holding the bull’s horn in one hand, the knife in the\nother, looked up at the President’s box. Handkerchiefs were waving all\nover the bull-ring. The President looked down from the box and waved his\nhandkerchief. The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull\nand trotted over with it to Romero. The bull lay heavy and black on the\nsand, his tongue out. Boys were running toward him from all parts of the\narena, making a little circle around him. They were starting to dance\naround the bull.\n\nRomero took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the\nPresident. The President bowed and Romero, running to get ahead of the\ncrowd, came toward us. He leaned up against the barrera and gave the ear\nto Brett. He nodded his head and smiled. The crowd were all about him.\nBrett held down the cape.\n\n“You liked it?” Romero called.\n\nBrett did not say anything. They looked at each other and smiled. Brett\nhad the ear in her hand.\n\n“Don’t get bloody,” Romero said, and grinned. The crowd wanted him.\nSeveral boys shouted at Brett. The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and\nthe drunks. Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were\nall around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He\nfought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them,\ntoward the exit. He did not want to be carried on people’s shoulders.\nBut they held him and lifted him. It was uncomfortable and his legs were\nspraddled and his body was very sore. They were lifting him and all\nrunning toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody’s shoulder. He\nlooked around at us apologetically. The crowd, running, went out the\ngate with him.\n\nWe all three went back to the hotel. Brett went up-stairs. Bill and I\nsat in the down-stairs dining-room and ate some hard-boiled eggs and\ndrank several bottles of beer. Belmonte came down in his street clothes\nwith his manager and two other men. They sat at the next table and ate.\nBelmonte ate very little. They were leaving on the seven o’clock train\nfor Barcelona. Belmonte wore a blue-striped shirt and a dark suit, and\nate soft-boiled eggs. The others ate a big meal. Belmonte did not talk.\nHe only answered questions.\n\nBill was tired after the bull-fight. So was I. We both took a bull-fight\nvery hard. We sat and ate the eggs and I watched Belmonte and the people\nat his table. The men with him were tough-looking and businesslike.\n\n“Come on over to the café,” Bill said. “I want an absinthe.”"}
{"text": "It was the last day of the fiesta. Outside it was beginning to be cloudy\nagain. The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were\nmaking up their set pieces for the night and covering them over with\nbeech branches. Boys were watching. We passed stands of rockets with\nlong bamboo stems. Outside the café there was a great crowd. The music\nand the dancing were going on. The giants and the dwarfs were passing.\n\n“Where’s Edna?” I asked Bill.\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nWe watched the beginning of the evening of the last night of the fiesta.\nThe absinthe made everything seem better. I drank it without sugar in\nthe dripping glass, and it was pleasantly bitter.\n\n“I feel sorry about Cohn,” Bill said. “He had an awful time.”\n\n“Oh, to hell with Cohn,” I said.\n\n“Where do you suppose he went?”\n\n“Up to Paris.”\n\n“What do you suppose he’ll do?”\n\n“Oh, to hell with him.”\n\n“What do you suppose he’ll do?”\n\n“Pick up with his old girl, probably.”\n\n“Who was his old girl?”\n\n“Somebody named Frances.”\n\nWe had another absinthe.\n\n“When do you go back?” I asked.\n\n“To-morrow.”\n\nAfter a little while Bill said: “Well, it was a swell fiesta.”\n\n“Yes,” I said; “something doing all the time.”\n\n“You wouldn’t believe it. It’s like a wonderful nightmare.”\n\n“Sure,” I said. “I’d believe anything. Including nightmares.”\n\n“What’s the matter? Feel low?”\n\n“Low as hell.”\n\n“Have another absinthe. Here, waiter! Another absinthe for this señor.”\n\n“I feel like hell,” I said.\n\n“Drink that,” said Bill. “Drink it slow.”\n\nIt was beginning to get dark. The fiesta was going on. I began to feel\ndrunk but I did not feel any better.\n\n“How do you feel?”\n\n“I feel like hell.”\n\n“Have another?”\n\n“It won’t do any good.”\n\n“Try it. You can’t tell; maybe this is the one that gets it. Hey,\nwaiter! Another absinthe for this señor!”\n\nI poured the water directly into it and stirred it instead of letting it\ndrip. Bill put in a lump of ice. I stirred the ice around with a spoon\nin the brownish, cloudy mixture.\n\n“How is it?”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“Don’t drink it fast that way. It will make you sick.”\n\nI set down the glass. I had not meant to drink it fast.\n\n“I feel tight.”\n\n“You ought to.”\n\n“That’s what you wanted, wasn’t it?”\n\n“Sure. Get tight. Get over your damn depression.”\n\n“Well, I’m tight. Is that what you want?”\n\n“Sit down.”\n\n“I won’t sit down,” I said. “I’m going over to the hotel.”\n\nI was very drunk. I was drunker than I ever remembered having been. At\nthe hotel I went up-stairs. Brett’s door was open. I put my head in the\nroom. Mike was sitting on the bed. He waved a bottle.\n\n“Jake,” he said. “Come in, Jake.”\n\nI went in and sat down. The room was unstable unless I looked at some\nfixed point.\n\n“Brett, you know. She’s gone off with the bull-fighter chap.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Yes. She looked for you to say good-bye. They went on the seven o’clock\ntrain.”\n\n“Did they?”\n\n“Bad thing to do,” Mike said. “She shouldn’t have done it.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Have a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer.”\n\n“I’m drunk,” I said. “I’m going in and lie down.”\n\n“Are you blind? I was blind myself.”\n\n“Yes,” I said, “I’m blind.”\n\n“Well, bung-o,” Mike said. “Get some sleep, old Jake.”\n\nI went out the door and into my own room and lay on the bed. The bed\nwent sailing off and I sat up in bed and looked at the wall to make it\nstop. Outside in the square the fiesta was going on. It did not mean\nanything. Later Bill and Mike came in to get me to go down and eat with\nthem. I pretended to be asleep.\n\n“He’s asleep. Better let him alone.”\n\n“He’s blind as a tick,” Mike said. They went out.\n\nI got up and went to the balcony and looked out at the dancing in the\nsquare. The world was not wheeling any more. It was just very clear and\nbright, and inclined to blur at the edges. I washed, brushed my hair. I\nlooked strange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the\ndining-room.\n\n“Here he is!” said Bill. “Good old Jake! I knew you wouldn’t pass out.”\n\n“Hello, you old drunk,” Mike said.\n\n“I got hungry and woke up.”\n\n“Eat some soup,” Bill said.\n\nThe three of us sat at the table, and it seemed as though about six\npeople were missing.\n\nCHAPTER\n                                   19"}
{"text": "In the morning it was all over. The fiesta was finished. I woke about\nnine o’clock, had a bath, dressed, and went down-stairs. The square was\nempty and there were no people on the streets. A few children were\npicking up rocket-sticks in the square. The cafés were just opening and\nthe waiters were carrying out the comfortable white wicker chairs and\narranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the\narcade. They were sweeping the streets and sprinkling them with a hose.\n\nI sat in one of the wicker chairs and leaned back comfortably. The\nwaiter was in no hurry to come. The white-paper announcements of the\nunloading of the bulls and the big schedules of special trains were\nstill up on the pillars of the arcade. A waiter wearing a blue apron\ncame out with a bucket of water and a cloth, and commenced to tear down\nthe notices, pulling the paper off in strips and washing and rubbing\naway the paper that stuck to the stone. The fiesta was over.\n\nI drank a coffee and after a while Bill came over. I watched him come\nwalking across the square. He sat down at the table and ordered a\ncoffee.\n\n“Well,” he said, “it’s all over.”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “When do you go?”\n\n“I don’t know. We better get a car, I think. Aren’t you going back to\nParis?”\n\n“No. I can stay away another week. I think I’ll go to San Sebastian.”\n\n“I want to get back.”\n\n“What’s Mike going to do?”\n\n“He’s going to Saint Jean de Luz.”\n\n“Let’s get a car and all go as far as Bayonne. You can get the train up\nfrom there to-night.”\n\n“Good. Let’s go after lunch.”\n\n“All right. I’ll get the car.”\n\nWe had lunch and paid the bill. Montoya did not come near us. One of the\nmaids brought the bill. The car was outside. The chauffeur piled and\nstrapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the\nfront seat and we got in. The car went out of the square, along through\nthe side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and away from\nPamplona. It did not seem like a very long ride. Mike had a bottle of\nFundador. I only took a couple of drinks. We came over the mountains and\nout of Spain and down the white roads and through the overfoliaged, wet,\ngreen, Basque country, and finally into Bayonne. We left Bill’s baggage\nat the station, and he bought a ticket to Paris. His train left at\nseven-ten. We came out of the station. The car was standing out in\nfront.\n\n“What shall we do about the car?” Bill asked.\n\n“Oh, bother the car,” Mike said. “Let’s just keep the car with us.”\n\n“All right,” Bill said. “Where shall we go?”\n\n“Let’s go to Biarritz and have a drink.”\n\n“Old Mike the spender,” Bill said.\n\nWe drove in to Biarritz and left the car outside a very Ritz place. We\nwent into the bar and sat on high stools and drank a whiskey and soda.\n\n“That drink’s mine,” Mike said.\n\n“Let’s roll for it.”\n\nSo we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup. Bill was out\nfirst roll. Mike lost to me and handed the bartender a hundred-franc\nnote. The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece. We had another round and\nMike lost again. Each time he gave the bartender a good tip. In a room\noff the bar there was a good jazz band playing. It was a pleasant bar.\nWe had another round. I went out on the first roll with four kings. Bill\nand Mike rolled. Mike won the first roll with four jacks. Bill won the\nsecond. On the final roll Mike had three kings and let them stay. He\nhanded the dice-cup to Bill. Bill rattled them and rolled, and there\nwere three kings, an ace, and a queen.\n\n“It’s yours, Mike,” Bill said. “Old Mike, the gambler.”\n\n“I’m so sorry,” Mike said. “I can’t get it.”\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“I’ve no money,” Mike said. “I’m stony. I’ve just twenty francs. Here,\ntake twenty francs.”\n\nBill’s face sort of changed.\n\n“I just had enough to pay Montoya. Damned lucky to have it, too.”\n\n“I’ll cash you a check,” Bill said.\n\n“That’s damned nice of you, but you see I can’t write checks.”\n\n“What are you going to do for money?”\n\n“Oh, some will come through. I’ve two weeks allowance should be here. I\ncan live on tick at this pub in Saint Jean.”\n\n“What do you want to do about the car?” Bill asked me. “Do you want to\nkeep it on?”\n\n“It doesn’t make any difference. Seems sort of idiotic.”"}
{"text": "“Come on, let’s have another drink,” Mike said.\n\n“Fine. This one is on me,” Bill said. “Has Brett any money?” He turned\nto Mike.\n\n“I shouldn’t think so. She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya.”\n\n“She hasn’t any money with her?” I asked.\n\n“I shouldn’t think so. She never has any money. She gets five hundred\nquid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to Jews.”\n\n“I suppose they get it at the source,” said Bill.\n\n“Quite. They’re not really Jews. We just call them Jews. They’re\nScotsmen, I believe.”\n\n“Hasn’t she any at all with her?” I asked.\n\n“I hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left.”\n\n“Well,” Bill said, “we might as well have another drink.”\n\n“Damned good idea,” Mike said. “One never gets anywhere by discussing\nfinances.”\n\n“No,” said Bill. Bill and I rolled for the next two rounds. Bill lost\nand paid. We went out to the car.\n\n“Anywhere you’d like to go, Mike?” Bill asked.\n\n“Let’s take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let’s drive about a\nlittle.”\n\n“Fine. I’d like to see the coast. Let’s drive down toward Hendaye.”\n\n“I haven’t any credit along the coast.”\n\n“You can’t ever tell,” said Bill.\n\nWe drove out along the coast road. There was the green of the headlands,\nthe white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue\nwith the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach. We\ndrove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down\nthe coast. Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the\nmountains we had come over from Pamplona. The road went on ahead. Bill\nlooked at his watch. It was time for us to go back. He knocked on the\nglass and told the driver to turn around. The driver backed the car out\ninto the grass to turn it. In back of us were the woods, below a stretch\nof meadow, then the sea.\n\nAt the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the\ncar and he got out. The chauffeur carried in his bags. Mike stood by the\nside of the car.\n\n“Good-bye, you chaps,” Mike said. “It was a damned fine fiesta.”\n\n“So long, Mike,” Bill said.\n\n“I’ll see you around,” I said.\n\n“Don’t worry about money,” Mike said. “You can pay for the car, Jake,\nand I’ll send you my share.”\n\n“So long, Mike.”\n\n“So long, you chaps. You’ve been damned nice.”\n\nWe all shook hands. We waved from the car to Mike. He stood in the road\nwatching. We got to Bayonne just before the train left. A porter carried\nBill’s bags in from the consigne. I went as far as the inner gate to the\ntracks.\n\n“So long, fella,” Bill said.\n\n“So long, kid!”\n\n“It was swell. I’ve had a swell time.”\n\n“Will you be in Paris?”\n\n“No, I have to sail on the 17th. So long, fella!”\n\n“So long, old kid!”\n\nHe went in through the gate to the train. The porter went ahead with the\nbags. I watched the train pull out. Bill was at one of the windows. The\nwindow passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty.\nI went outside to the car.\n\n“How much do we owe you?” I asked the driver. The price to Bayonne had\nbeen fixed at a hundred and fifty pesetas.\n\n“Two hundred pesetas.”\n\n“How much more will it be if you drive me to San Sebastian on your way\nback?”\n\n“Fifty pesetas.”\n\n“Don’t kid me.”\n\n“Thirty-five pesetas.”\n\n“It’s not worth it,” I said. “Drive me to the Hotel Panier Fleuri.”\n\nAt the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip. The car was powdered\nwith dust. I rubbed the rod-case through the dust. It seemed the last\nthing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta. The driver put the\ncar in gear and went down the street. I watched it turn off to take the\nroad to Spain. I went into the hotel and they gave me a room. It was the\nsame room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne. That\nseemed a very long time ago. I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in\nthe town."}
{"text": "At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York _Herald_ and sat\nin a café to read it. It felt strange to be in France again. There was a\nsafe, suburban feeling. I wished I had gone up to Paris with Bill,\nexcept that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing. I was through with\nfiestas for a while. It would be quiet in San Sebastian. The season does\nnot open there until August. I could get a good hotel room and read and\nswim. There was a fine beach there. There were wonderful trees along the\npromenade above the beach, and there were many children sent down with\ntheir nurses before the season opened. In the evening there would be\nband concerts under the trees across from the Café Marinas. I could sit\nin the Marinas and listen.\n\n“How does one eat inside?” I asked the waiter. Inside the café was a\nrestaurant.\n\n“Well. Very well. One eats very well.”\n\n“Good.”\n\nI went in and ate dinner. It was a big meal for France but it seemed\nvery carefully apportioned after Spain. I drank a bottle of wine for\ncompany. It was a Château Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly\nand to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine\nwas good company. Afterward I had coffee. The waiter recommended a\nBasque liqueur called Izzarra. He brought in the bottle and poured a\nliqueur-glass full. He said Izzarra was made of the flowers of the\nPyrenees. The veritable flowers of the Pyrenees. It looked like hair-oil\nand smelled like Italian _strega_. I told him to take the flowers of the\nPyrenees away and bring me a _vieux marc_. The _marc_ was good. I had a\nsecond _marc_ after the coffee.\n\nThe waiter seemed a little offended about the flowers of the Pyrenees,\nso I overtipped him. That made him happy. It felt comfortable to be in a\ncountry where it is so simple to make people happy. You can never tell\nwhether a Spanish waiter will thank you. Everything is on such a clear\nfinancial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one\nmakes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason.\nIf you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I\nspent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable\nqualities. He would be glad to see me back. I would dine there again\nsome time and he would be glad to see me, and would want me at his\ntable. It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis.\nI was back in France.\n\nNext morning I tipped every one a little too much at the hotel to make\nmore friends, and left on the morning train for San Sebastian. At the\nstation I did not tip the porter more than I should because I did not\nthink I would ever see him again. I only wanted a few good French\nfriends in Bayonne to make me welcome in case I should come back there\nagain. I knew that if they remembered me their friendship would be\nloyal.\n\nAt Irun we had to change trains and show passports. I hated to leave\nFrance. Life was so simple in France. I felt I was a fool to be going\nback into Spain. In Spain you could not tell about anything. I felt like\na fool to be going back into it, but I stood in line with my passport,\nopened my bags for the customs, bought a ticket, went through a gate,\nclimbed onto the train, and after forty minutes and eight tunnels I was\nat San Sebastian.\n\nEven on a hot day San Sebastian has a certain early-morning quality. The\ntrees seem as though their leaves were never quite dry. The streets feel\nas though they had just been sprinkled. It is always cool and shady on\ncertain streets on the hottest day. I went to a hotel in the town where\nI had stopped before, and they gave me a room with a balcony that opened\nout above the roofs of the town. There was a green mountainside beyond\nthe roofs.\n\nI unpacked my bags and stacked my books on the table beside the head of\nthe bed, put out my shaving things, hung up some clothes in the big\narmoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry. Then I took a shower in\nthe bathroom and went down to lunch. Spain had not changed to\nsummer-time, so I was early. I set my watch again. I had recovered an\nhour by coming to San Sebastian."}
{"text": "As I went into the dining-room the concierge brought me a police\nbulletin to fill out. I signed it and asked him for two telegraph forms,\nand wrote a message to the Hotel Montoya, telling them to forward all\nmail and telegrams for me to this address. I calculated how many days I\nwould be in San Sebastian and then wrote out a wire to the office asking\nthem to hold mail, but forward all wires for me to San Sebastian for six\ndays. Then I went in and had lunch.\n\nAfter lunch I went up to my room, read a while, and went to sleep. When\nI woke it was half past four. I found my swimming-suit, wrapped it with\na comb in a towel, and went down-stairs and walked up the street to the\nConcha. The tide was about half-way out. The beach was smooth and firm,\nand the sand yellow. I went into a bathing-cabin, undressed, put on my\nsuit, and walked across the smooth sand to the sea. The sand was warm\nunder bare feet. There were quite a few people in the water and on the\nbeach. Out beyond where the headlands of the Concha almost met to form\nthe harbor there was a white line of breakers and the open sea. Although\nthe tide was going out, there were a few slow rollers. They came in like\nundulations in the water, gathered weight of water, and then broke\nsmoothly on the warm sand. I waded out. The water was cold. As a roller\ncame I dove, swam out under water, and came to the surface with all the\nchill gone. I swam out to the raft, pulled myself up, and lay on the hot\nplanks. A boy and girl were at the other end. The girl had undone the\ntop strap of her bathing-suit and was browning her back. The boy lay\nface downward on the raft and talked to her. She laughed at things he\nsaid, and turned her brown back in the sun. I lay on the raft in the sun\nuntil I was dry. Then I tried several dives. I dove deep once, swimming\ndown to the bottom. I swam with my eyes open and it was green and dark.\nThe raft made a dark shadow. I came out of water beside the raft, pulled\nup, dove once more, holding it for length, and then swam ashore. I lay\non the beach until I was dry, then went into the bathing-cabin, took off\nmy suit, sloshed myself with fresh water, and rubbed dry.\n\nI walked around the harbor under the trees to the casino, and then up\none of the cool streets to the Café Marinas. There was an orchestra\nplaying inside the café and I sat out on the terrace and enjoyed the\nfresh coolness in the hot day, and had a glass of lemon-juice and shaved\nice and then a long whiskey and soda. I sat in front of the Marinas for\na long time and read and watched the people, and listened to the music.\n\nLater when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out\nalong the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper. There was\na bicycle-race on, the Tour du Pays Basque, and the riders were stopping\nthat night in San Sebastian. In the dining-room, at one side, there was\na long table of bicycle-riders, eating with their trainers and managers.\nThey were all French and Belgians, and paid close attention to their\nmeal, but they were having a good time. At the head of the table were\ntwo good-looking French girls, with much Rue du Faubourg Montmartre\nchic. I could not make out whom they belonged to. They all spoke in\nslang at the long table and there were many private jokes and some jokes\nat the far end that were not repeated when the girls asked to hear them.\nThe next morning at five o’clock the race resumed with the last lap, San\nSebastian-Bilbao. The bicycle-riders drank much wine, and were burned\nand browned by the sun. They did not take the race seriously except\namong themselves. They had raced among themselves so often that it did\nnot make much difference who won. Especially in a foreign country. The\nmoney could be arranged.\n\nThe man who had a matter of two minutes lead in the race had an attack\nof boils, which were very painful. He sat on the small of his back. His\nneck was very red and the blond hairs were sunburned. The other riders\njoked him about his boils. He tapped on the table with his fork."}
{"text": "“Listen,” he said, “to-morrow my nose is so tight on the handle-bars\nthat the only thing touches those boils is a lovely breeze.”\n\nOne of the girls looked at him down the table, and he grinned and turned\nred. The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal.\n\nI had coffee out on the terrasse with the team manager of one of the big\nbicycle manufacturers. He said it had been a very pleasant race, and\nwould have been worth watching if Bottechia had not abandoned it at\nPamplona. The dust had been bad, but in Spain the roads were better than\nin France. Bicycle road-racing was the only sport in the world, he said.\nHad I ever followed the Tour de France? Only in the papers. The Tour de\nFrance was the greatest sporting event in the world. Following and\norganizing the road races had made him know France. Few people know\nFrance. All spring and all summer and all fall he spent on the road with\nbicycle road-racers. Look at the number of motor-cars now that followed\nthe riders from town to town in a road race. It was a rich country and\nmore _sportif_ every year. It would be the most _sportif_ country in the\nworld. It was bicycle road-racing did it. That and football. He knew\nFrance. _La France Sportive._ He knew road-racing. We had a cognac.\nAfter all, though, it wasn’t bad to get back to Paris. There is only one\nPaname. In all the world, that is. Paris is the town the most _sportif_\nin the world. Did I know the _Chope de Negre_? Did I not. I would see\nhim there some time. I certainly would. We would drink another _fine_\ntogether. We certainly would. They started at six o’clock less a quarter\nin the morning. Would I be up for the depart? I would certainly try to.\nWould I like him to call me? It was very interesting. I would leave a\ncall at the desk. He would not mind calling me. I could not let him take\nthe trouble. I would leave a call at the desk. We said good-bye until\nthe next morning.\n\nIn the morning when I awoke the bicycle-riders and their following cars\nhad been on the road for three hours. I had coffee and the papers in bed\nand then dressed and took my bathing-suit down to the beach. Everything\nwas fresh and cool and damp in the early morning. Nurses in uniform and\nin peasant costume walked under the trees with children. The Spanish\nchildren were beautiful. Some bootblacks sat together under a tree\ntalking to a soldier. The soldier had only one arm. The tide was in and\nthere was a good breeze and a surf on the beach.\n\nI undressed in one of the bath-cabins, crossed the narrow line of beach\nand went into the water. I swam out, trying to swim through the rollers,\nbut having to dive sometimes. Then in the quiet water I turned and\nfloated. Floating I saw only the sky, and felt the drop and lift of the\nswells. I swam back to the surf and coasted in, face down, on a big\nroller, then turned and swam, trying to keep in the trough and not have\na wave break over me. It made me tired, swimming in the trough, and I\nturned and swam out to the raft. The water was buoyant and cold. It felt\nas though you could never sink. I swam slowly, it seemed like a long\nswim with the high tide, and then pulled up on the raft and sat,\ndripping, on the boards that were becoming hot in the sun. I looked\naround at the bay, the old town, the casino, the line of trees along the\npromenade, and the big hotels with their white porches and gold-lettered\nnames. Off on the right, almost closing the harbor, was a green hill\nwith a castle. The raft rocked with the motion of the water. On the\nother side of the narrow gap that led into the open sea was another high\nheadland. I thought I would like to swim across the bay but I was afraid\nof cramp.\n\nI sat in the sun and watched the bathers on the beach. They looked very\nsmall. After a while I stood up, gripped with my toes on the edge of the\nraft as it tipped with my weight, and dove cleanly and deeply, to come\nup through the lightening water, blew the salt water out of my head, and\nswam slowly and steadily in to shore."}
{"text": "After I was dressed and had paid for the bath-cabin, I walked back to\nthe hotel. The bicycle-racers had left several copies of _L’Auto_\naround, and I gathered them up in the reading-room and took them out and\nsat in an easy chair in the sun to read about and catch up on French\nsporting life. While I was sitting there the concierge came out with a\nblue envelope in his hand.\n\n“A telegram for you, sir.”\n\nI poked my finger along under the fold that was fastened down, spread it\nopen, and read it. It had been forwarded from Paris:\n\nCOULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID\n                  AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT.\n\nI tipped the concierge and read the message again. A postman was coming\nalong the sidewalk. He turned in the hotel. He had a big moustache and\nlooked very military. He came out of the hotel again. The concierge was\njust behind him.\n\n“Here’s another telegram for you, sir.”\n\n“Thank you,” I said.\n\nI opened it. It was forwarded from Pamplona.\n\nCOULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID\n                  AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT.\n\nThe concierge stood there waiting for another tip, probably.\n\n“What time is there a train for Madrid?”\n\n“It left at nine this morning. There is a slow train at eleven, and the\nSud Express at ten to-night.”\n\n“Get me a berth on the Sud Express. Do you want the money now?”\n\n“Just as you wish,” he said. “I will have it put on the bill.”\n\n“Do that.”\n\nWell, that meant San Sebastian all shot to hell. I suppose, vaguely, I\nhad expected something of the sort. I saw the concierge standing in the\ndoorway.\n\n“Bring me a telegram form, please.”\n\nHe brought it and I took out my fountain-pen and printed:\n\nLADY ASHLEY HOTEL MONTANA MADRID\n                   ARRIVING SUD EXPRESS TOMORROW LOVE\n                   JAKE.\n\nThat seemed to handle it. That was it. Send a girl off with one man.\nIntroduce her to another to go off with him. Now go and bring her back.\nAnd sign the wire with love. That was it all right. I went in to lunch.\n\nI did not sleep much that night on the Sud Express. In the morning I had\nbreakfast in the dining-car and watched the rock and pine country\nbetween Avila and Escorial. I saw the Escorial out of the window, gray\nand long and cold in the sun, and did not give a damn about it. I saw\nMadrid come up over the plain, a compact white sky-line on the top of a\nlittle cliff away off across the sun-hardened country.\n\nThe Norte station in Madrid is the end of the line. All trains finish\nthere. They don’t go on anywhere. Outside were cabs and taxis and a line\nof hotel runners. It was like a country town. I took a taxi and we\nclimbed up through the gardens, by the empty palace and the unfinished\nchurch on the edge of the cliff, and on up until we were in the high,\nhot, modern town. The taxi coasted down a smooth street to the Puerta\ndel Sol, and then through the traffic and out into the Carrera San\nJeronimo. All the shops had their awnings down against the heat. The\nwindows on the sunny side of the street were shuttered. The taxi stopped\nat the curb. I saw the sign HOTEL MONTANA on the second floor. The\ntaxi-driver carried the bags in and left them by the elevator. I could\nnot make the elevator work, so I walked up. On the second floor up was a\ncut brass sign: HOTEL MONTANA. I rang and no one came to the door. I\nrang again and a maid with a sullen face opened the door.\n\n“Is Lady Ashley here?” I asked.\n\nShe looked at me dully.\n\n“Is an Englishwoman here?”\n\nShe turned and called some one inside. A very fat woman came to the\ndoor. Her hair was gray and stiffly oiled in scallops around her face.\nShe was short and commanding.\n\n“Muy buenos,” I said. “Is there an Englishwoman here? I would like to\nsee this English lady.”\n\n“Muy buenos. Yes, there is a female English. Certainly you can see her\nif she wishes to see you.”\n\n“She wishes to see me.”\n\n“The chica will ask her.”\n\n“It is very hot.”\n\n“It is very hot in the summer in Madrid.”\n\n“And how cold in winter.”\n\n“Yes, it is very cold in winter.”\n\nDid I want to stay myself in person in the Hotel Montana?"}
{"text": "Of that as yet I was undecided, but it would give me pleasure if my bags\nwere brought up from the ground floor in order that they might not be\nstolen. Nothing was ever stolen in the Hotel Montana. In other fondas,\nyes. Not here. No. The personages of this establishment were rigidly\nselectioned. I was happy to hear it. Nevertheless I would welcome the\nupbringal of my bags.\n\nThe maid came in and said that the female English wanted to see the male\nEnglish now, at once.\n\n“Good,” I said. “You see. It is as I said.”\n\n“Clearly.”\n\nI followed the maid’s back down a long, dark corridor. At the end she\nknocked on a door.\n\n“Hello,” said Brett. “Is it you, Jake?”\n\n“It’s me.”\n\n“Come in. Come in.”\n\nI opened the door. The maid closed it after me. Brett was in bed. She\nhad just been brushing her hair and held the brush in her hand. The room\nwas in that disorder produced only by those who have always had\nservants.\n\n“Darling!” Brett said.\n\nI went over to the bed and put my arms around her. She kissed me, and\nwhile she kissed me I could feel she was thinking of something else. She\nwas trembling in my arms. She felt very small.\n\n“Darling! I’ve had such a hell of a time.”\n\n“Tell me about it.”\n\n“Nothing to tell. He only left yesterday. I made him go.”\n\n“Why didn’t you keep him?”\n\n“I don’t know. It isn’t the sort of thing one does. I don’t think I hurt\nhim any.”\n\n“You were probably damn good for him.”\n\n“He shouldn’t be living with any one. I realized that right away.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Oh, hell!” she said, “let’s not talk about it. Let’s never talk about\nit.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“It was rather a knock his being ashamed of me. He was ashamed of me for\na while, you know.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Oh, yes. They ragged him about me at the café, I guess. He wanted me to\ngrow my hair out. Me, with long hair. I’d look so like hell.”\n\n“It’s funny.”\n\n“He said it would make me more womanly. I’d look a fright.”\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“Oh, he got over that. He wasn’t ashamed of me long.”\n\n“What was it about being in trouble?”\n\n“I didn’t know whether I could make him go, and I didn’t have a sou to\ngo away and leave him. He tried to give me a lot of money, you know. I\ntold him I had scads of it. He knew that was a lie. I couldn’t take his\nmoney, you know.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Oh, let’s not talk about it. There were some funny things, though. Do\ngive me a cigarette.”\n\nI lit the cigarette.\n\n“He learned his English as a waiter in Gib.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“He wanted to marry me, finally.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Of course. I can’t even marry Mike.”\n\n“Maybe he thought that would make him Lord Ashley.”\n\n“No. It wasn’t that. He really wanted to marry me. So I couldn’t go away\nfrom him, he said. He wanted to make it sure I could never go away from\nhim. After I’d gotten more womanly, of course.”\n\n“You ought to feel set up.”\n\n“I do. I’m all right again. He’s wiped out that damned Cohn.”\n\n“Good.”\n\n“You know I’d have lived with him if I hadn’t seen it was bad for him.\nWe got along damned well.”\n\n“Outside of your personal appearance.”\n\n“Oh, he’d have gotten used to that.”\n\nShe put out the cigarette.\n\n“I’m thirty-four, you know. I’m not going to be one of these bitches\nthat ruins children.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I’m not going to be that way. I feel rather good, you know. I feel\nrather set up.”\n\n“Good.”\n\nShe looked away. I thought she was looking for another cigarette. Then I\nsaw she was crying. I could feel her crying. Shaking and crying. She\nwouldn’t look up. I put my arms around her.\n\n“Don’t let’s ever talk about it. Please don’t let’s ever talk about it.”\n\n“Dear Brett.”\n\n“I’m going back to Mike.” I could feel her crying as I held her close.\n“He’s so damned nice and he’s so awful. He’s my sort of thing.”\n\nShe would not look up. I stroked her hair. I could feel her shaking.\n\n“I won’t be one of those bitches,” she said. “But, oh, Jake, please\nlet’s never talk about it.”\n\nWe left the Hotel Montana. The woman who ran the hotel would not let me\npay the bill. The bill had been paid.\n\n“Oh, well. Let it go,” Brett said. “It doesn’t matter now.”\n\nWe rode in a taxi down to the Palace Hotel, left the bags, arranged for\nberths on the Sud Express for the night, and went into the bar of the\nhotel for a cocktail. We sat on high stools at the bar while the barman\nshook the Martinis in a large nickelled shaker."}
{"text": "“It’s funny what a wonderful gentility you get in the bar of a big\nhotel,” I said.\n\n“Barmen and jockeys are the only people who are polite any more.”\n\n“No matter how vulgar a hotel is, the bar is always nice.”\n\n“It’s odd.”\n\n“Bartenders have always been fine.”\n\n“You know,” Brett said, “it’s quite true. He is only nineteen. Isn’t it\namazing?”\n\nWe touched the two glasses as they stood side by side on the bar. They\nwere coldly beaded. Outside the curtained window was the summer heat of\nMadrid.\n\n“I like an olive in a Martini,” I said to the barman.\n\n“Right you are, sir. There you are.”\n\n“Thanks.”\n\n“I should have asked, you know.”\n\nThe barman went far enough up the bar so that he would not hear our\nconversation. Brett had sipped from the Martini as it stood, on the\nwood. Then she picked it up. Her hand was steady enough to lift it after\nthat first sip.\n\n“It’s good. Isn’t it a nice bar?”\n\n“They’re all nice bars.”\n\n“You know I didn’t believe it at first. He was born in 1905. I was in\nschool in Paris, then. Think of that.”\n\n“Anything you want me to think about it?”\n\n“Don’t be an ass. _Would_ you buy a lady a drink?”\n\n“We’ll have two more Martinis.”\n\n“As they were before, sir?”\n\n“They were very good.” Brett smiled at him.\n\n“Thank you, ma’am.”\n\n“Well, bung-o,” Brett said.\n\n“Bung-o!”\n\n“You know,” Brett said, “he’d only been with two women before. He never\ncared about anything but bull-fighting.”\n\n“He’s got plenty of time.”\n\n“I don’t know. He thinks it was me. Not the show in general.”\n\n“Well, it was you.”\n\n“Yes. It was me.”\n\n“I thought you weren’t going to ever talk about it.”\n\n“How can I help it?”\n\n“You’ll lose it if you talk about it.”\n\n“I just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, Jake.”\n\n“You should.”\n\n“You know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It’s sort of what we have instead of God.”\n\n“Some people have God,” I said. “Quite a lot.”\n\n“He never worked very well with me.”\n\n“Should we have another Martini?”\n\nThe barman shook up two more Martinis and poured them out into fresh\nglasses.\n\n“Where will we have lunch?” I asked Brett. The bar was cool. You could\nfeel the heat outside through the window.\n\n“Here?” asked Brett.\n\n“It’s rotten here in the hotel. Do you know a place called Botin’s?” I\nasked the barman.\n\n“Yes, sir. Would you like to have me write out the address?”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\nWe lunched up-stairs at Botin’s. It is one of the best restaurants in\nthe world. We had roast young suckling pig and drank _rioja_ _alta_.\nBrett did not eat much. She never ate much. I ate a very big meal and\ndrank three bottles of _rioja alta_.\n\n“How do you feel, Jake?” Brett asked. “My God! what a meal you’ve\neaten.”\n\n“I feel fine. Do you want a dessert?”\n\n“Lord, no.”\n\nBrett was smoking.\n\n“You like to eat, don’t you?” she said.\n\n“Yes.” I said. “I like to do a lot of things.”\n\n“What do you like to do?”\n\n“Oh,” I said, “I like to do a lot of things. Don’t you want a dessert?”\n\n“You asked me that once,” Brett said.\n\n“Yes,” I said. “So I did. Let’s have another bottle of _rioja alta_.”\n\n“It’s very good.”\n\n“You haven’t drunk much of it,” I said.\n\n“I have. You haven’t seen.”\n\n“Let’s get two bottles,” I said. The bottles came. I poured a little in\nmy glass, then a glass for Brett, then filled my glass. We touched\nglasses.\n\n“Bung-o!” Brett said. I drank my glass and poured out another. Brett put\nher hand on my arm.\n\n“Don’t get drunk, Jake,” she said. “You don’t have to.”\n\n“How do you know?”\n\n“Don’t,” she said. “You’ll be all right.”\n\n“I’m not getting drunk,” I said. “I’m just drinking a little wine. I\nlike to drink wine.”\n\n“Don’t get drunk,” she said. “Jake, don’t get drunk.”\n\n“Want to go for a ride?” I said. “Want to ride through the town?”\n\n“Right,” Brett said. “I haven’t seen Madrid. I should see Madrid.”\n\n“I’ll finish this,” I said."}
{"text": "Down-stairs we came out through the first-floor dining-room to the\nstreet. A waiter went for a taxi. It was hot and bright. Up the street\nwas a little square with trees and grass where there were taxis parked.\nA taxi came up the street, the waiter hanging out at the side. I tipped\nhim and told the driver where to drive, and got in beside Brett. The\ndriver started up the street. I settled back. Brett moved close to me.\nWe sat close against each other. I put my arm around her and she rested\nagainst me comfortably. It was very hot and bright, and the houses\nlooked sharply white. We turned out onto the Gran Via.\n\n“Oh, Jake,” Brett said, “we could have had such a damned good time\ntogether.”\n\nAhead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic. He raised his\nbaton.

He set\ndown his suitcase and knocked on the door. There was no answer. Manuel,\nstanding in the hallway, felt there was some one in the room. He felt it\nthrough the door.\n\n“Retana,” he said, listening.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nHe’s there, all right, Manuel thought.\n\n“Retana,” he said and banged the door.\n\n“Who’s there?” said some one in the office.\n\n“Me, Manolo,” Manuel said.\n\n“What do you want?” asked the voice.\n\n“I want to work,” Manuel said.\n\nSomething in the door clicked several times and it swung open. Manuel\nwent in, carrying his suitcase.\n\nA little man sat behind a desk at the far side of the room. Over his\nhead was a bull’s head, stuffed by a Madrid taxidermist; on the walls\nwere framed photographs and bull-fight posters.\n\nThe little man sat looking at Manuel.\n\n“I thought they’d killed you,” he said.\n\nManuel knocked with his knuckles on the desk. The little man sat looking\nat him across the desk.\n\n“How many corridas you had this year?” Retana asked.\n\n“One,” he answered.\n\n“Just that one?” the little man asked.\n\n“That’s all.”\n\n“I read about it in the papers,” Retana said. He leaned back in the\nchair and looked at Manuel.\n\nManuel looked up at the stuffed bull. He had seen it often before. He\nfelt a certain family interest in it. It had killed his brother, the\npromising one, about nine years ago. Manuel remembered the day. There\nwas a brass plate on the oak shield the bull’s head was mounted on.\nManuel could not read it, but he imagined it was in memory of his\nbrother. Well, he had been a good kid.\n\nThe plate said: “The Bull ‘Mariposa’ of the Duke of Veragua, which\naccepted 9 varas for 7 caballos, and caused the death of Antonio Garcia,\nNovillero, April 27, 1909.”\n\nRetana saw him looking at the stuffed bull’s head.\n\n“The lot the Duke sent me for Sunday will make a scandal,” he said.\n“They’re all bad in the legs. What do they say about them at the Café?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Manuel said. “I just got in.”\n\n“Yes,” Retana said. “You still have your bag.”\n\nHe looked at Manuel, leaning back behind the big desk.\n\n“Sit down,” he said. “Take off your cap.”\n\nManuel sat down; his cap off, his face was changed. He looked pale, and\nhis coleta pinned forward on his head, so that it would not show under\nthe cap, gave him a strange look.\n\n“You don’t look well,” Retana said.\n\n“I just got out of the hospital,” Manuel said.\n\n“I heard they’d cut your leg off,” Retana said.\n\n“No,” said Manuel. “It got all right.”\n\nRetana leaned forward across the desk and pushed a wooden box of\ncigarettes toward Manuel.\n\n“Have a cigarette,” he said.\n\n“Thanks.”\n\nManuel lit it.\n\n“Smoke?” he said, offering the match to Retana.\n\n“No,” Retana waved his hand, “I never smoke.”\n\nRetana watched him smoking.\n\n“Why don’t you get a job and go to work?” he said.\n\n“I don’t want to work,” Manuel said. “I am a bull-fighter.”\n\n“There aren’t any bull-fighters any more,” Retana said.\n\n“I’m a bull-fighter,” Manuel said.\n\n“Yes, while you’re in there,” Retana said.\n\nManuel laughed.\n\nRetana sat, saying nothing and looking at Manuel.\n\n“I’ll put you in a nocturnal if you want,” Retana offered.\n\n“When?” Manuel asked.\n\n“To-morrow night.”\n\n“I don’t like to substitute for anybody,” Manuel said. That was the way\nthey all got killed. That was the way Salvador got killed. He tapped\nwith his knuckles on the table.\n\n“It’s all I’ve got,” Retana said."}
{"text": "“Why don’t you put me on next week?” Manuel suggested.\n\n“You wouldn’t draw,” Retana said. “All they want is Litri and Rubito and\nLa Torre. Those kids are good.”\n\n“They’d come to see me get it,” Manuel said, hopefully.\n\n“No, they wouldn’t. They don’t know who you are any more.”\n\n“I’ve got a lot of stuff,” Manuel said.\n\n“I’m offering to put you on to-morrow night,” Retana said. “You can work\nwith young Hernandez and kill two novillos after the Chariots.”\n\n“Whose novillos?” Manuel asked.\n\n“I don’t know. Whatever stuff they’ve got in the corrals. What the\nveterinaries won’t pass in the daytime.”\n\n“I don’t like to substitute,” Manuel said.\n\n“You can take it or leave it,” Retana said. He leaned forward over the\npapers. He was no longer interested. The appeal that Manuel had made to\nhim for a moment when he thought of the old days was gone. He would like\nto get him to substitute for Larita because he could get him cheaply. He\ncould get others cheaply too. He would like to help him though. Still he\nhad given him the chance. It was up to him.\n\n“How much do I get?” Manuel asked. He was still playing with the idea of\nrefusing. But he knew he could not refuse.\n\n“Two hundred and fifty pesetas,” Retana said. He had thought of five\nhundred, but when he opened his mouth it said two hundred and fifty.\n\n“You pay Villalta seven thousand,” Manuel said.\n\n“You’re not Villalta,” Retana said.\n\n“I know it,” Manuel said.\n\n“He draws it, Manolo,” Retana said in explanation.\n\n“Sure,” said Manuel. He stood up. “Give me three hundred, Retana.”\n\n“All right,” Retana agreed. He reached in the drawer for a paper.\n\n“Can I have fifty now?” Manuel asked.\n\n“Sure,” said Retana. He took a fifty peseta note out of his pocket-book\nand laid it, spread out flat, on the table.\n\nManuel picked it up and put it in his pocket.\n\n“What about a cuadrilla?” he asked.\n\n“There’s the boys that always work for me nights,” Retana said. “They’re\nall right.”\n\n“How about picadors?” Manuel asked.\n\n“They’re not much,” Retana admitted.\n\n“I’ve got to have one good pic,” Manuel said.\n\n“Get him then,” Retana said. “Go and get him.”\n\n“Not out of this,” Manuel said. “I’m not paying for any cuadrilla out of\nsixty duros.”\n\nRetana said nothing but looked at Manuel across the big desk.\n\n“You know I’ve got to have one good pic,” Manuel said.\n\nRetana said nothing but looked at Manuel from a long way off.\n\n“It isn’t right,” Manuel said.\n\nRetana was still considering him, leaning back in his chair, considering\nhim from a long way away.\n\n“There’re the regular pics,” he offered.\n\n“I know,” Manuel said. “I know your regular pics.”\n\nRetana did not smile. Manuel knew it was over.\n\n“All I want is an even break,” Manuel said reasoningly. “When I go out\nthere I want to be able to call my shots on the bull. It only takes one\ngood picador.”\n\nHe was talking to a man who was no longer listening.\n\n“If you want something extra,” Retana said, “go and get it. There will\nbe a regular cuadrilla out there. Bring as many of your own pics as you\nwant. The charlotada is over by 10.30.”\n\n“All right,” Manuel said. “If that’s the way you feel about it.”\n\n“That’s the way,” Retana said.\n\n“I’ll see you to-morrow night,” Manuel said.\n\n“I’ll be out there,” Retana said.\n\nManuel picked up his suitcase and went out.\n\n“Shut the door,” Retana called.\n\nManuel looked back. Retana was sitting forward looking at some papers.\nManuel pulled the door tight until it clicked.\n\nHe went down the stairs and out of the door into the hot brightness of\nthe street. It was very hot in the street and the light on the white\nbuildings was sudden and hard on his eyes. He walked down the shady side\nof the steep street toward the Puerta del Sol. The shade felt solid and\ncool as running water. The heat came suddenly as he crossed the\nintersecting streets. Manuel saw no one he knew in all the people he\npassed.\n\nJust before the Puerta del Sol he turned into a café.\n\nIt was quiet in the café. There were a few men sitting at tables against\nthe wall. At one table four men played cards. Most of the men sat\nagainst the wall smoking, empty coffee-cups and liqueur-glasses before\nthem on the tables. Manuel went through the long room to a small room in\nback. A man sat at a table in the corner asleep. Manuel sat down at one\nof the tables."}
{"text": "A waiter came in and stood beside Manuel’s table.\n\n“Have you seen Zurito?” Manuel asked him.\n\n“He was in before lunch,” the waiter answered. “He won’t be back before\nfive o’clock.”\n\n“Bring me some coffee and milk and a shot of the ordinary,” Manuel said.\n\nThe waiter came back into the room carrying a tray with a big\ncoffee-glass and a liqueur-glass on it. In his left hand he held a\nbottle of brandy. He swung these down to the table and a boy who had\nfollowed him poured coffee and milk into the glass from two shiny,\nspouted pots with long handles.\n\nManuel took off his cap and the waiter noticed his pigtail pinned\nforward on his head. He winked at the coffee-boy as he poured out the\nbrandy into the little glass beside Manuel’s coffee. The coffee-boy\nlooked at Manuel’s pale face curiously.\n\n“You fighting here?” asked the waiter, corking up the bottle.\n\n“Yes,” Manuel said. “To-morrow.”\n\nThe waiter stood there, holding the bottle on one hip.\n\n“You in the Charlie Chaplins?” he asked.\n\nThe coffee-boy looked away, embarrassed.\n\n“No. In the ordinary.”\n\n“I thought they were going to have Chaves and Hernandez,” the waiter\nsaid.\n\n“No. Me and another.”\n\n“Who? Chaves or Hernandez?”\n\n“Hernandez, I think.”\n\n“What’s the matter with Chaves?”\n\n“He got hurt.”\n\n“Where did you hear that?”\n\n“Retana.”\n\n“Hey, Looie,” the waiter called to the next room, “Chaves got cogida.”\n\nManuel had taken the wrapper off the lumps of sugar and dropped them\ninto his coffee. He stirred it and drank it down, sweet, hot, and\nwarming in his empty stomach. He drank off the brandy.\n\n“Give me another shot of that,” he said to the waiter.\n\nThe waiter uncorked the bottle and poured the glass full, slopping\nanother drink into the saucer. Another waiter had come up in front of\nthe table. The coffee-boy was gone.\n\n“Is Chaves hurt bad?” the second waiter asked Manuel.\n\n“I don’t know,” Manuel said, “Retana didn’t say.”\n\n“A hell of a lot he cares,” the tall waiter said. Manuel had not seen\nhim before. He must have just come up.\n\n“If you stand in with Retana in this town, you’re a made man,” the tall\nwaiter said. “If you aren’t in with him, you might just as well go out\nand shoot yourself.”\n\n“You said it,” the other waiter who had come in said. “You said it\nthen.”\n\n“You’re right I said it,” said the tall waiter. “I know what I’m talking\nabout when I talk about that bird.”\n\n“Look what he’s done for Villalta,” the first waiter said.\n\n“And that ain’t all,” the tall waiter said. “Look what he’s done for\nMarcial Lalanda. Look what he’s done for Nacional.”\n\n“You said it, kid,” agreed the short waiter.\n\nManuel looked at them, standing talking in front of his table. He had\ndrunk his second brandy. They had forgotten about him. They were not\ninterested in him.\n\n“Look at that bunch of camels,” the tall waiter went on. “Did you ever\nsee this Nacional II?”\n\n“I seen him last Sunday didn’t I?” the original waiter said.\n\n“He’s a giraffe,” the short waiter said.\n\n“What did I tell you?” the tall waiter said. “Those are Retana’s boys.”\n\n“Say, give me another shot of that,” Manuel said. He had poured the\nbrandy the waiter had slopped over in the saucer into his glass and\ndrank it while they were talking.\n\nThe original waiter poured his glass full mechanically, and the three of\nthem went out of the room talking.\n\nIn the far corner the man was still asleep, snoring slightly on the\nintaking breath, his head back against the wall.\n\nManuel drank his brandy. He felt sleepy himself. It was too hot to go\nout into the town. Besides there was nothing to do. He wanted to see\nZurito. He would go to sleep while he waited. He kicked his suitcase\nunder the table to be sure it was there. Perhaps it would be better to\nput it back under the seat, against the wall. He leaned down and shoved\nit under. Then he leaned forward on the table and went to sleep."}
{"text": "When he woke there was some one sitting across the table from him. It\nwas a big man with a heavy brown face like an Indian. He had been\nsitting there some time. He had waved the waiter away and sat reading\nthe paper and occasionally looking down at Manuel, asleep, his head on\nthe table. He read the paper laboriously, forming the words with his\nlips as he read. When it tired him he looked at Manuel. He sat heavily\nin the chair, his black Cordoba hat tipped forward.\n\nManuel sat up and looked at him.\n\n“Hello, Zurito,” he said.\n\n“Hello, kid,” the big man said.\n\n“I’ve been asleep.” Manuel rubbed his forehead with the back of his\nfist.\n\n“I thought maybe you were.”\n\n“How’s everything?”\n\n“Good. How is everything with you?”\n\n“Not so good.”\n\nThey were both silent. Zurito, the picador, looked at Manuel’s white\nface. Manuel looked down at the picador’s enormous hands folding the\npaper to put away in his pocket.\n\n“I got a favor to ask you, Manos,” Manuel said.\n\nManosduros was Zurito’s nickname. He never heard it without thinking of\nhis huge hands. He put them forward on the table self-consciously.\n\n“Let’s have a drink,” he said.\n\n“Sure,” said Manuel.\n\nThe waiter came and went and came again. He went out of the room looking\nback at the two men at the table.\n\n“What’s the matter, Manolo?” Zurito set down his glass.\n\n“Would you pic two bulls for me to-morrow night?” Manuel asked, looking\nup at Zurito across the table.\n\n“No,” said Zurito. “I’m not pic-ing.”\n\nManuel looked down at his glass. He had expected that answer; now he had\nit. Well, he had it.\n\n“I’m sorry, Manolo, but I’m not pic-ing.” Zurito looked at his hands.\n\n“That’s all right,” Manuel said.\n\n“I’m too old,” Zurito said.\n\n“I just asked you,” Manuel said.\n\n“Is it the nocturnal to-morrow?”\n\n“That’s it. I figured if I had just one good pic, I could get away with\nit.”\n\n“How much are you getting?”\n\n“Three hundred pesetas.”\n\n“I get more than that for pic-ing.”\n\n“I know,” said Manuel. “I didn’t have any right to ask you.”\n\n“What do you keep on doing it for?” Zurito asked. “Why don’t you cut off\nyour coleta, Manolo?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Manuel said.\n\n“You’re pretty near as old as I am,” Zurito said.\n\n“I don’t know,” Manuel said. “I got to do it. If I can fix it so that I\nget an even break, that’s all I want. I got to stick with it, Manos.”\n\n“No, you don’t.”\n\n“Yes, I do. I’ve tried keeping away from it.”\n\n“I know how you feel. But it isn’t right. You ought to get out and stay\nout.”\n\n“I can’t do it. Besides, I’ve been going good lately.”\n\nZurito looked at his face.\n\n“You’ve been in the hospital.”\n\n“But I was going great when I got hurt.”\n\nZurito said nothing. He tipped the cognac out of his saucer into his\nglass.\n\n“The papers said they never saw a better faena,” Manuel said.\n\nZurito looked at him.\n\n“You know when I get going I’m good,” Manuel said.\n\n“You’re too old,” the picador said.\n\n“No,” said Manuel. “You’re ten years older than I am.”\n\n“With me it’s different.”\n\n“I’m not too old,” Manuel said.\n\nThey sat silent, Manuel watching the picador’s face.\n\n“I was going great till I got hurt,” Manuel offered.\n\n“You ought to have seen me, Manos,” Manuel said, reproachfully.\n\n“I don’t want to see you,” Zurito said. “It makes me nervous.”\n\n“You haven’t seen me lately.”\n\n“I’ve seen you plenty.”\n\nZurito looked at Manuel, avoiding his eyes.\n\n“You ought to quit it, Manolo.”\n\n“I can’t,” Manuel said. “I’m going good now, I tell you.”\n\nZurito leaned forward, his hands on the table.\n\n“Listen. I’ll pic for you and if you don’t go big to-morrow night,\nyou’ll quit. See? Will you do that?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\nZurito leaned back, relieved.\n\n“You got to quit,” he said. “No monkey business. You got to cut the\ncoleta.”\n\n“I won’t have to quit,” Manuel said. “You watch me. I’ve got the stuff.”\n\nZurito stood up. He felt tired from arguing.\n\n“You got to quit,” he said. “I’ll cut your coleta myself.”\n\n“No, you won’t,” Manuel said. “You won’t have a chance.”\n\nZurito called the waiter.\n\n“Come on,” said Zurito. “Come on up to the house.”\n\nManuel reached under the seat for his suitcase. He was happy. He knew\nZurito would pic for him. He was the best picador living. It was all\nsimple now.\n\n“Come on up to the house and we’ll eat,” Zurito said.\n\n*        *        *        *        *"}
{"text": "Manuel stood in the patio de caballos waiting for the Charlie Chaplins\nto be over. Zurito stood beside him. Where they stood it was dark. The\nhigh door that led into the bull-ring was shut. Above them they heard a\nshout, then another shout of laughter. Then there was silence. Manuel\nliked the smell of the stables about the patio de caballos. It smelt\ngood in the dark. There was another roar from the arena and then\napplause, prolonged applause, going on and on.\n\n“You ever seen these fellows?” Zurito asked, big and looming beside\nManuel in the dark.\n\n“No,” Manuel said.\n\n“They’re pretty funny.” Zurito said. He smiled to himself in the dark.\n\nThe high, double, tight-fitting door into the bull-ring swung open and\nManuel saw the ring in the hard light of the arc-lights, the plaza, dark\nall the way around, rising high; around the edge of the ring were\nrunning and bowing two men dressed like tramps, followed by a third in\nthe uniform of a hotel bell-boy who stooped and picked up the hats and\ncanes thrown down onto the sand and tossed them back up into the\ndarkness.\n\nThe electric light went on in the patio.\n\n“I’ll climb onto one of those ponies while you collect the kids,” Zurito\nsaid.\n\nBehind them came the jingle of the mules, coming out to go into the\narena and be hitched onto the dead bull.\n\nThe members of the cuadrilla, who had been watching the burlesque from\nthe runway between the barrera and the seats, came walking back and\nstood in a group talking, under the electric light in the patio. A\ngood-looking lad in a silver-and-orange suit came up to Manuel and\nsmiled.\n\n“I’m Hernandez,” he said and put out his hand.\n\nManuel shook it.\n\n“They’re regular elephants we’ve got to-night,” the boy said cheerfully.\n\n“They’re big ones with horns,” Manuel agreed.\n\n“You drew the worst lot,” the boy said.\n\n“That’s all right,” Manuel said. “The bigger they are, the more meat for\nthe poor.”\n\n“Where did you get that one?” Hernandez grinned.\n\n“That’s an old one,” Manuel said. “You line up your cuadrilla, so I can\nsee what I’ve got.”\n\n“You’ve got some good kids,” Hernandez said. He was very cheerful. He\nhad been on twice before in nocturnals and was beginning to get a\nfollowing in Madrid. He was happy the fight would start in a few\nminutes.\n\n“Where are the pics?” Manuel asked.\n\n“They’re back in the corrals fighting about who gets the beautiful\nhorses,” Hernandez grinned.\n\nThe mules came through the gate in a rush, the whips snapping, bells\njangling and the young bull ploughing a furrow of sand.\n\nThey formed up for the paseo as soon as the bull had gone through.\n\nManuel and Hernandez stood in front. The youths of the cuadrillas were\nbehind, their heavy capes furled over their arms. In back, the four\npicadors, mounted, holding their steel-tipped push-poles erect in the\nhalf-dark of the corral.\n\n“It’s a wonder Retana wouldn’t give us enough light to see the horses\nby,” one picador said.\n\n“He knows we’ll be happier if we don’t get too good a look at these\nskins,” another pic answered.\n\n“This thing I’m on barely keeps me off the ground,” the first picador\nsaid.\n\n“Well, they’re horses.”\n\n“Sure, they’re horses.”\n\nThey talked, sitting their gaunt horses in the dark.\n\nZurito said nothing. He had the only steady horse of the lot. He had\ntried him, wheeling him in the corrals and he responded to the bit and\nthe spurs. He had taken the bandage off his right eye and cut the\nstrings where they had tied his ears tight shut at the base. He was a\ngood, solid horse, solid on his legs. That was all he needed. He\nintended to ride him all through the corrida. He had already, since he\nhad mounted, sitting in the half-dark in the big, quilted saddle,\nwaiting for the paseo, pic-ed through the whole corrida in his mind. The\nother picadors went on talking on both sides of him. He did not hear\nthem.\n\nThe two matadors stood together in front of their three peones, their\ncapes furled over their left arms in the same fashion. Manuel was\nthinking about the three lads in back of him. They were all three\nMadrileños, like Hernandez, boys about nineteen. One of them, a gypsy,\nserious, aloof, and dark-faced, he liked the look of. He turned.\n\n“What’s your name, kid?” he asked the gypsy."}
{"text": "“Fuentes,” the gypsy said.\n\n“That’s a good name,” Manuel said.\n\nThe gypsy smiled, showing his teeth.\n\n“You take the bull and give him a little run when he comes out,” Manuel\nsaid.\n\n“All right,” the gypsy said. His face was serious. He began to think\nabout just what he would do.\n\n“Here she goes,” Manuel said to Hernandez.\n\n“All right. We’ll go.”\n\nHeads up, swinging with the music, their right arms swinging free, they\nstepped out, crossing the sanded arena under the arc-lights, the\ncuadrillas opening out behind, the picadors riding after, behind came\nthe bull-ring servants and the jingling mules. The crowd applauded\nHernandez as they marched across the arena. Arrogant, swinging, they\nlooked straight ahead as they marched.\n\nThey bowed before the president, and the procession broke up into its\ncomponent parts. The bull-fighters went over to the barrera and changed\ntheir heavy mantles for the light fighting capes. The mules went out.\nThe picadors galloped jerkily around the ring, and two rode out the gate\nthey had come in by. The servants swept the sand smooth.\n\nManuel drank a glass of water poured for him by one of Retana’s\ndeputies, who was acting as his manager and sword-handler. Hernandez\ncame over from speaking with his own manager.\n\n“You got a good hand, kid,” Manuel complimented him.\n\n“They like me,” Hernandez said happily.\n\n“How did the paseo go?” Manuel asked Retana’s man.\n\n“Like a wedding,” said the handler. “Fine. You came out like Joselito\nand Belmonte.”\n\nZurito rode by, a bulky equestrian statue. He wheeled his horse and\nfaced him toward the toril on the far side of the ring where the bull\nwould come out. It was strange under the arc-light. He pic-ed in the hot\nafternoon sun for big money. He didn’t like this arc-light business. He\nwished they would get started.\n\nManuel went up to him.\n\n“Pic him, Manos,” he said. “Cut him down to size for me.”\n\n“I’ll pic him, kid,” Zurito spat on the sand. “I’ll make him jump out of\nthe ring.”\n\n“Lean on him, Manos,” Manuel said.\n\n“I’ll lean on him,” Zurito said. “What’s holding it up?”\n\n“He’s coming now,” Manuel said.\n\nZurito sat there, his feet in the box-stirrups, his great legs in the\nbuckskin-covered armor gripping the horse, the reins in his left hand,\nthe long pic held in his right hand, his broad hat well down over his\neyes to shade them from the lights, watching the distant door of the\ntoril. His horse’s ears quivered. Zurito patted him with his left hand.\n\nThe red door of the toril swung back and for a moment Zurito looked into\nthe empty passageway far across the arena. Then the bull came out in a\nrush, skidding on his four legs as he came out under the lights, then\ncharging in a gallop, moving softly in a fast gallop, silent except as\nhe woofed through wide nostrils as he charged, glad to be free after the\ndark pen.\n\nIn the first row of seats, slightly bored, leaning forward to write on\nthe cement wall in front of his knees, the substitute bull-fight critic\nof _El Heraldo_ scribbled: “Campagnero, Negro, 42, came out at 90 miles\nan hour with plenty of gas——”\n\nManuel, leaning against the barrera, watching the bull, waved his hand\nand the gypsy ran out, trailing his cape. The bull, in full gallop,\npivoted and charged the cape, his head down, his tail rising. The gypsy\nmoved in a zigzag, and as he passed, the bull caught sight of him and\nabandoned the cape to charge the man. The gyp sprinted and vaulted the\nred fence of the barrera as the bull struck it with his horns. He tossed\ninto it twice with his horns, banging into the wood blindly.\n\nThe critic of _El Heraldo_ lit a cigarette and tossed the match at the\nbull, then wrote in his note-book, “large and with enough horns to\nsatisfy the cash customers, Campagnero showed a tendency to cut into the\nterrane of the bull-fighters.”"}
{"text": "Manuel stepped out on the hard sand as the bull banged into the fence.\nOut of the corner of his eye he saw Zurito sitting the white horse close\nto the barrera, about a quarter of the way around the ring to the left.\nManuel held the cape close in front of him, a fold in each hand, and\nshouted at the bull. “Huh! Huh!” The bull turned, seemed to brace\nagainst the fence as he charged in a scramble, driving into the cape as\nManuel side-stepped, pivoted on his heels with the charge of the bull,\nand swung the cape just ahead of the horns. At the end of the swing he\nwas facing the bull again and held the cape in the same position close\nin front of his body, and pivoted again as the bull recharged. Each\ntime, as he swung, the crowd shouted.\n\nFour times he swung with the bull, lifting the cape so it billowed full,\nand each time bringing the bull around to charge again. Then, at the end\nof the fifth swing, he held the cape against his hip and pivoted, so the\ncape swung out like a ballet dancer’s skirt and wound the bull around\nhimself like a belt, to step clear, leaving the bull facing Zurito on\nthe white horse, come up and planted firm, the horse facing the bull,\nits ears forward, its lips nervous, Zurito, his hat over his eyes,\nleaning forward, the long pole sticking out before and behind in a sharp\nangle under his right arm, held half-way down, the triangular iron point\nfacing the bull.\n\n_El Heraldo’s_ second-string critic, drawing on his cigarette, his eyes\non the bull, wrote: “the veteran Manolo designed a series of acceptable\nveronicas, ending in a very Belmontistic recorte that earned applause\nfrom the regulars, and we entered the tercio of the cavalry.”\n\nZurito sat his horse, measuring the distance between the bull and the\nend of the pic. As he looked, the bull gathered himself together and\ncharged, his eyes on the horse’s chest. As he lowered his head to hook,\nZurito sunk the point of the pic in the swelling hump of muscle above\nthe bull’s shoulder, leaned all his weight on the shaft, and with his\nleft hand pulled the white horse into the air, front hoofs pawing, and\nswung him to the right as he pushed the bull under and through so the\nhorns passed safely under the horse’s belly and the horse came down,\nquivering, the bull’s tail brushing his chest as he charged the cape\nHernandez offered him.\n\nHernandez ran sideways, taking the bull out and away with the cape,\ntoward the other picador. He fixed him with a swing of the cape,\nsquarely facing the horse and rider, and stepped back. As the bull saw\nthe horse he charged. The picador’s lance slid along his back, and as\nthe shock of the charge lifted the horse, the picador was already\nhalf-way out of the saddle, lifting his right leg clear as he missed\nwith the lance and falling to the left side to keep the horse between\nhim and the bull. The horse, lifted and gored, crashed over with the\nbull driving into him, the picador gave a shove with his boots against\nthe horse and lay clear, waiting to be lifted and hauled away and put on\nhis feet.\n\nManuel let the bull drive into the fallen horse; he was in no hurry, the\npicador was safe; besides, it did a picador like that good to worry.\nHe’d stay on longer next time. Lousy pics! He looked across the sand at\nZurito a little way out from the barrera, his horse rigid, waiting.\n\n“Huh!” he called to the bull, “Tomar!” holding the cape in both hands so\nit would catch his eye. The bull detached himself from the horse and\ncharged the cape, and Manuel, running sideways and holding the cape\nspread wide, stopped, swung on his heels, and brought the bull sharply\naround facing Zurito.\n\n“Campagnero accepted a pair of varas for the death of one rosinante,\nwith Hernandez and Manolo at the quites,” _El Heraldo’s_ critic wrote.\n“He pressed on the iron and clearly showed he was no horse-lover. The\nveteran Zurito resurrected some of his old stuff with the pike-pole,\nnotably the suerte——”"}
{"text": "“Olé Olé!” the man sitting beside him shouted. The shout was lost in the\nroar of the crowd, and he slapped the critic on the back. The critic\nlooked up to see Zurito, directly below him, leaning far out over his\nhorse, the length of the pic rising in a sharp angle under his armpit,\nholding the pic almost by the point, bearing down with all his weight,\nholding the bull off, the bull pushing and driving to get at the horse,\nand Zurito, far out, on top of him, holding him, holding him, and slowly\npivoting the horse against the pressure, so that at last he was clear.\nZurito felt the moment when the horse was clear and the bull could come\npast, and relaxed the absolute steel lock of his resistance, and the\ntriangular steel point of the pic ripped in the bull’s hump of shoulder\nmuscle as he tore loose to find Hernandez’s cape before his muzzle. He\ncharged blindly into the cape and the boy took him out into the open\narena.\n\nZurito sat patting his horse and looking at the bull charging the cape\nthat Hernandez swung for him out under the bright light while the crowd\nshouted.\n\n“You see that one?” he said to Manuel.\n\n“It was a wonder,” Manuel said.\n\n“I got him that time,” Zurito said. “Look at him now.”\n\nAt the conclusion of a closely turned pass of the cape the bull slid to\nhis knees. He was up at once, but far out across the sand Manuel and\nZurito saw the shine of the pumping flow of blood, smooth against the\nblack of the bull’s shoulder.\n\n“I got him that time,” Zurito said.\n\n“He’s a good bull,” Manuel said.\n\n“If they gave me another shot at him, I’d kill him,” Zurito said.\n\n“They’ll change the thirds on us,” Manuel said.\n\n“Look at him now,” Zurito said.\n\n“I got to go over there,” Manuel said, and started on a run for the\nother side of the ring, where the monos were leading a horse out by the\nbridle toward the bull, whacking him on the legs with rods and all, in a\nprocession, trying to get him toward the bull, who stood, dropping his\nhead, pawing, unable to make up his mind to charge.\n\nZurito, sitting his horse, walking him toward the scene, not missing any\ndetail, scowled.\n\nFinally the bull charged, the horse leaders ran for the barrera, the\npicador hit too far back, and the bull got under the horse, lifted him,\nthrew him onto his back.\n\nZurito watched. The monos, in their red shirts, running out to drag the\npicador clear. The picador, now on his feet, swearing and flopping his\narms. Manuel and Hernandez standing ready with their capes. And the\nbull, the great, black bull, with a horse on his back, hooves dangling,\nthe bridle caught in the horns. Black bull with a horse on his back,\nstaggering short-legged, then arching his neck and lifting, thrusting,\ncharging to slide the horse off, horse sliding down. Then the bull into\na lunging charge at the cape Manuel spread for him.\n\nThe bull was slower now, Manuel felt. He was bleeding badly. There was a\nsheen of blood all down his flank.\n\nManuel offered him the cape again. There he came, eyes open, ugly,\nwatching the cape. Manuel stepped to the side and raised his arms,\ntightening the cape ahead of the bull for the veronica.\n\nNow he was facing the bull. Yes, his head was going down a little. He\nwas carrying it lower. That was Zurito.\n\nManuel flopped the cape; there he comes; he side-stepped and swung in\nanother veronica. He’s shooting awfully accurately, he thought. He’s had\nenough fight, so he’s watching now. He’s hunting now. Got his eye on me.\nBut I always give him the cape.\n\nHe shook the cape at the bull; there he comes; he side-stepped. Awful\nclose that time. I don’t want to work that close to him.\n\nThe edge of the cape was wet with blood where it had swept along the\nbull’s back as he went by.\n\nAll right, here’s the last one.\n\nManuel, facing the bull, having turned with him each charge, offered the\ncape with his two hands. The bull looked at him. Eyes watching, horns\nstraight forward, the bull looked at him, watching."}
{"text": "“Huh!” Manuel said, “Toro!” and leaning back, swung the cape forward.\nHere he comes. He side-stepped, swung the cape in back of him, and\npivoted, so the bull followed a swirl of cape and then was left with\nnothing, fixed by the pass, dominated by the cape. Manuel swung the cape\nunder his muzzle with one hand, to show the bull was fixed, and walked\naway.\n\nThere was no applause.\n\nManuel walked across the sand toward the barrera, while Zurito rode out\nof the ring. The trumpet had blown to change the act to the planting of\nthe banderillos while Manuel had been working with the bull. He had not\nconsciously noticed it. The monos were spreading canvas over the two\ndead horses and sprinkling sawdust around them.\n\nManuel came up to the barrera for a drink of water. Retana’s man handed\nhim the heavy porous jug.\n\nFuentes, the tall gypsy, was standing holding a pair of banderillos,\nholding them together, slim, red sticks, fish-hook points out. He looked\nat Manuel.\n\n“Go on out there,” Manuel said.\n\nThe gypsy trotted out. Manuel set down the jug and watched. He wiped his\nface with his handkerchief.\n\nThe critic of _El Heraldo_ reached for the bottle of warm champagne that\nstood between his feet, took a drink, and finished his paragraph.\n\n“—the aged Manolo rated no applause for a vulgar series of lances with\nthe cape and we entered the third of the palings.”\n\nAlone in the centre of the ring the bull stood, still fixed. Fuentes,\ntall, flat-backed, walking toward him arrogantly, his arms spread out,\nthe two slim, red sticks, one in each hand, held by the fingers, points\nstraight forward. Fuentes walked forward. Back of him and to one side\nwas a peon with a cape. The bull looked at him and was no longer fixed.\n\nHis eyes watched Fuentes, now standing still. Now he leaned back,\ncalling to him. Fuentes twitched the two banderillos and the light on\nthe steel points caught the bull’s eye.\n\nHis tail went up and he charged.\n\nHe came straight, his eyes on the man. Fuentes stood still, leaning\nback, the banderillos pointing forward. As the bull lowered his head to\nhook, Fuentes leaned backward, his arms came together and rose, his two\nhands touching, the banderillos two descending red lines, and leaning\nforward drove the points into the bull’s shoulder, leaning far in over\nthe bull’s horns and pivoting on the two upright sticks, his legs tight\ntogether, his body curving to one side to let the bull pass.\n\n“Olé!” from the crowd.\n\nThe bull was hooking wildly, jumping like a trout, all four feet off the\nground. The red shaft of the banderillos tossed as he jumped.\n\nManuel standing at the barrera, noticed that he hooked always to the\nright.\n\n“Tell him to drop the next pair on the right,” he said to the kid who\nstarted to run out to Fuentes with the new banderillos.\n\nA heavy hand fell on his shoulder. It was Zurito.\n\n“How do you feel, kid?” he asked.\n\nManuel was watching the bull.\n\nZurito leaned forward on the barrera, leaning the weight of his body on\nhis arms. Manuel turned to him.\n\n“You’re going good,” Zurito said.\n\nManuel shook his head. He had nothing to do now until the next third.\nThe gypsy was very good with the banderillos. The bull would come to him\nin the next third in good shape. He was a good bull. It had all been\neasy up to now. The final stuff with the sword was all he worried over.\nHe did not really worry. He did not even think about it. But standing\nthere he had a heavy sense of apprehension. He looked out at the bull,\nplanning his faena, his work with the red cloth that was to reduce the\nbull, to make him manageable.\n\nThe gypsy was walking out toward the bull again, walking heel-and-toe,\ninsultingly, like a ball-room dancer, the red shafts of the banderillos\ntwitching with his walk. The bull watched him, not fixed now, hunting\nhim, but waiting to get close enough so he could be sure of getting him,\ngetting the horns into him."}
{"text": "As Fuentes walked forward the bull charged. Fuentes ran across the\nquarter of a circle as the bull charged and, as he passed running\nbackward, stopped, swung forward, rose on his toes, arms straight out,\nand sunk the banderillos straight down into the tight of the big\nshoulder muscles as the bull missed him.\n\nThe crowd were wild about it.\n\n“That kid won’t stay in this night stuff long,” Retana’s man said to\nZurito.\n\n“He’s good,” Zurito said.\n\n“Watch him now.”\n\nThey watched.\n\nFuentes was standing with his back against the barrera. Two of the\ncuadrilla were back of him, with their capes ready to flop over the\nfence to distract the bull.\n\nThe bull, with his tongue out, his barrel heaving, was watching the\ngypsy. He thought he had him now. Back against the red planks. Only a\nshort charge away. The bull watched him.\n\nThe gypsy bent back, drew back his arms, the banderillos pointing at the\nbull. He called to the bull, stamped one foot. The bull was suspicious.\nHe wanted the man. No more barbs in the shoulder.\n\nFuentes walked a little closer to the bull. Bent back. Called again.\nSomebody in the crowd shouted a warning.\n\n“He’s too damn close,” Zurito said.\n\n“Watch him,” Retana’s man said.\n\nLeaning back, inciting the bull with the banderillos, Fuentes jumped,\nboth feet off the ground. As he jumped the bull’s tail rose and he\ncharged. Fuentes came down on his toes, arms straight out, whole body\narching forward, and drove the shafts straight down as he swung his body\nclear of the right horn.\n\nThe bull crashed into the barrera where the flopping capes had attracted\nhis eye as he lost the man.\n\nThe gypsy came running along the barrera toward Manuel, taking the\napplause of the crowd. His vest was ripped where he had not quite\ncleared the point of the horn. He was happy about it, showing it to the\nspectators. He made the tour of the ring. Zurito saw him go by, smiling,\npointing at his vest. He smiled.\n\nSomebody else was planting the last pair of banderillos. Nobody was\npaying any attention.\n\nRetana’s man tucked a baton inside the red cloth of a muleta, folded the\ncloth over it, and handed it over the barrera to Manuel. He reached in\nthe leather sword-case, took out a sword, and holding it by its leather\nscabbard, reached it over the fence to Manuel. Manuel pulled the blade\nout by the red hilt and the scabbard fell limp.\n\nHe looked at Zurito. The big man saw he was sweating.\n\n“Now you get him, kid,” Zurito said.\n\nManuel nodded.\n\n“He’s in good shape,” Zurito said.\n\n“Just like you want him,” Retana’s man assured him.\n\nManuel nodded.\n\nThe trumpeter, up under the roof, blew for the final act, and Manuel\nwalked across the arena toward where, up in the dark boxes, the\npresident must be.\n\nIn the front row of seats the substitute bull-fight critic of _El\nHeraldo_ took a long drink of the warm champagne. He had decided it was\nnot worth while to write a running story and would write up the corrida\nback in the office. What the hell was it anyway? Only a nocturnal. If he\nmissed anything he would get it out of the morning papers. He took\nanother drink of the champagne. He had a date at Maxim’s at twelve. Who\nwere these bull-fighters anyway? Kids and bums. A bunch of bums. He put\nhis pad of paper in his pocket and looked over toward Manuel, standing\nvery much alone in the ring, gesturing with his hat in a salute toward a\nbox he could not see high up in the dark plaza. Out in the ring the bull\nstood quiet, looking at nothing.\n\n“I dedicate this bull to you, Mr. President, and to the public of\nMadrid, the most intelligent and generous of the world,” was what Manuel\nwas saying. It was a formula. He said it all. It was a little long for\nnocturnal use.\n\nHe bowed at the dark, straightened, tossed his hat over his shoulder,\nand, carrying the muleta in his left hand and the sword in his right,\nwalked out toward the bull."}
{"text": "Manuel walked toward the bull. The bull looked at him; his eyes were\nquick. Manuel noticed the way the banderillos hung down on his left\nshoulder and the steady sheen of blood from Zurito’s pic-ing. He noticed\nthe way the bull’s feet were. As he walked forward, holding the muleta\nin his left hand and the sword in his right, he watched the bull’s feet.\nThe bull could not charge without gathering his feet together. Now he\nstood square on them, dully.\n\nManuel walked toward him, watching his feet. This was all right. He\ncould do this. He must work to get the bull’s head down, so he could go\nin past the horns and kill him. He did not think about the sword, not\nabout killing the bull. He thought about one thing at a time. The coming\nthings oppressed him, though. Walking forward, watching the bull’s feet,\nhe saw successively his eyes, his wet muzzle, and the wide,\nforward-pointing spread of his horns. The bull had light circles about\nhis eyes. His eyes watched Manuel. He felt he was going to get this\nlittle one with the white face.\n\nStanding still now and spreading the red cloth of the muleta with the\nsword, pricking the point into the cloth so that the sword, now held in\nhis left hand, spread the red flannel like the jib of a boat, Manuel\nnoticed the points of the bull’s horns. One of them was splintered from\nbanging against the barrera. The other was sharp as a porcupine quill.\nManuel noticed while spreading the muleta that the white base of the\nhorn was stained red. While he noticed these things he did not lose\nsight of the bull’s feet. The bull watched Manuel steadily.\n\nHe’s on the defensive now, Manuel thought. He’s reserving himself. I’ve\ngot to bring him out of that and get his head down. Always get his head\ndown. Zurito had his head down once, but he’s come back. He’ll bleed\nwhen I start him going and that will bring it down.\n\nHolding the muleta, with the sword in his left hand widening it in front\nof him, he called to the bull.\n\nThe bull looked at him.\n\nHe leaned back insultingly and shook the wide-spread flannel.\n\nThe bull saw the muleta. It was a bright scarlet under the arc-light.\nThe bull’s legs tightened.\n\nHere he comes. Whoosh! Manuel turned as the bull came and raised the\nmuleta so that it passed over the bull’s horns and swept down his broad\nback from head to tail. The bull had gone clean up in the air with the\ncharge. Manuel had not moved.\n\nAt the end of the pass the bull turned like a cat coming around a corner\nand faced Manuel.\n\nHe was on the offensive again. His heaviness was gone. Manuel noted the\nfresh blood shining down the black shoulder and dripping down the bull’s\nleg. He drew the sword out of the muleta and held it in his right hand.\nThe muleta held low down in his left hand, leaning toward the left, he\ncalled to the bull. The bull’s legs tightened, his eyes on the muleta.\nHere he comes, Manuel thought. Yuh!\n\nHe swung with the charge, sweeping the muleta ahead of the bull, his\nfeet firm, the sword following the curve, a point of light under the\narcs.\n\nThe bull recharged as the pase natural finished and Manuel raised the\nmuleta for a pase de pecho. Firmly planted, the bull came by his chest\nunder the raised muleta. Manuel leaned his head back to avoid the\nclattering banderillo shafts. The hot, black bull body touched his chest\nas it passed.\n\nToo damn close, Manuel thought. Zurito, leaning on the barrera, spoke\nrapidly to the gypsy, who trotted out toward Manuel with a cape. Zurito\npulled his hat down low and looked out across the arena at Manuel.\n\nManuel was facing the bull again, the muleta held low and to the left.\nThe bull’s head was down as he watched the muleta.\n\n“If it was Belmonte doing that stuff, they’d go crazy,” Retana’s man\nsaid.\n\nZurito said nothing. He was watching Manuel out in the centre of the\narena.\n\n“Where did the boss dig this fellow up?” Retana’s man asked.\n\n“Out of the hospital,” Zurito said.\n\n“That’s where he’s going damn quick,” Retana’s man said.\n\nZurito turned on him.\n\n“Knock on that,” he said, pointing to the barrera.\n\n“I was just kidding, man,” Retana’s man said.\n\n“Knock on the wood.”\n\nRetana’s man leaned forward and knocked three times on the barrera."}
{"text": "“Watch the faena,” Zurito said.\n\nOut in the centre of the ring, under the lights, Manuel was kneeling,\nfacing the bull, and as he raised the muleta in both hands the bull\ncharged, tail up.\n\nManuel swung his body clear and, as the bull recharged, brought around\nthe muleta in a half-circle that pulled the bull to his knees.\n\n“Why, that one’s a great bull-fighter,” Retana’s man said.\n\n“No, he’s not,” said Zurito.\n\nManuel stood up and, the muleta in his left hand, the sword in his\nright, acknowledged the applause from the dark plaza.\n\nThe bull had humped himself up from his knees and stood waiting, his\nhead hung low.\n\nZurito spoke to two of the other lads of the cuadrilla and they ran out\nto stand back of Manuel with their capes. There were four men back of\nhim now. Hernandez had followed him since he first came out with the\nmuleta. Fuentes stood watching, his cape held against his body, tall, in\nrepose, watching lazy-eyed. Now the two came up. Hernandez motioned them\nto stand one at each side. Manuel stood alone, facing the bull.\n\nManuel waved back the men with the capes. Stepping back cautiously, they\nsaw his face was white and sweating.\n\nDidn’t they know enough to keep back? Did they want to catch the bull’s\neye with the capes after he was fixed and ready? He had enough to worry\nabout without that kind of thing.\n\nThe bull was standing, his four feet square, looking at the muleta.\nManuel furled the muleta in his left hand. The bull’s eyes watched it.\nHis body was heavy on his feet. He carried his head low, but not too\nlow.\n\nManuel lifted the muleta at him. The bull did not move. Only his eyes\nwatched.\n\nHe’s all lead, Manuel thought. He’s all square. He’s framed right. He’ll\ntake it.\n\nHe thought in bull-fight terms. Sometimes he had a thought and the\nparticular piece of slang would not come into his mind and he could not\nrealize the thought. His instincts and his knowledge worked\nautomatically, and his brain worked slowly and in words. He knew all\nabout bulls. He did not have to think about them. He just did the right\nthing. His eyes noted things and his body performed the necessary\nmeasures without thought. If he thought about it, he would be gone.\n\nNow, facing the bull, he was conscious of many things at the same time.\nThere were the horns, the one splintered, the other smoothly sharp, the\nneed to profile himself toward the left horn, lance himself short and\nstraight, lower the muleta so the bull would follow it, and, going in\nover the horns, put the sword all the way into a little spot about as\nbig as a five-peseta piece straight in back of the neck, between the\nsharp pitch of the bull’s shoulders. He must do all this and must then\ncome out from between the horns. He was conscious he must do all this,\nbut his only thought was in words: “Corto y derecho.”\n\n“Corto y derecho,” he thought, furling the muleta. Short and straight.\nCorto y derecho, he drew the sword out of the muleta, profiled on the\nsplintered left horn, dropped the muleta across his body, so his right\nhand with the sword on the level with his eye made the sign of the\ncross, and, rising on his toes, sighted along the dipping blade of the\nsword at the spot high up between the bull’s shoulders.\n\nCorto y derecho he lanced himself on the bull.\n\nThere was a shock, and he felt himself go up in the air. He pushed on\nthe sword as he went up and over, and it flew out of his hand. He hit\nthe ground and the bull was on him. Manuel, lying on the ground, kicked\nat the bull’s muzzle with his slippered feet. Kicking, kicking, the bull\nafter him, missing him in his excitement, bumping him with his head,\ndriving the horns into the sand. Kicking like a man keeping a ball in\nthe air, Manuel kept the bull from getting a clean thrust at him.\n\nManuel felt the wind on his back from the capes flopping at the bull,\nand then the bull was gone, gone over him in a rush. Dark, as his belly\nwent over. Not even stepped on."}
{"text": "Manuel stood up and picked up the muleta. Fuentes handed him the sword.\nIt was bent where it had struck the shoulder-blade. Manuel straightened\nit on his knee and ran toward the bull, standing now beside one of the\ndead horses. As he ran, his jacket flopped where it had been ripped\nunder his armpit.\n\n“Get him out of there,” Manuel shouted to the gypsy. The bull had\nsmelled the blood of the dead horse and ripped into the canvas-cover\nwith his horns. He charged Fuentes’s cape, with the canvas hanging from\nhis splintered horn, and the crowd laughed. Out in the ring, he tossed\nhis head to rid himself of the canvas. Hernandez, running up from behind\nhim, grabbed the end of the canvas and neatly lifted it off the horn.\n\nThe bull followed it in a half-charge and stopped still. He was on the\ndefensive again. Manuel was walking toward him with the sword and\nmuleta. Manuel swung the muleta before him. The bull would not charge.\n\nManuel profiled toward the bull, sighting along the dipping blade of the\nsword. The bull was motionless, seemingly dead on his feet, incapable of\nanother charge.\n\nManuel rose to his toes, sighting along the steel, and charged.\n\nAgain there was the shock and he felt himself being borne back in a\nrush, to strike hard on the sand. There was no chance of kicking this\ntime. The bull was on top of him. Manuel lay as though dead, his head on\nhis arms, and the bull bumped him. Bumped his back, bumped his face in\nthe sand. He felt the horn go into the sand between his folded arms. The\nbull hit him in the small of the back. His face drove into the sand. The\nhorn drove through one of his sleeves and the bull ripped it off. Manuel\nwas tossed clear and the bull followed the capes.\n\nManuel got up, found the sword and muleta, tried the point of the sword\nwith his thumb, and then ran toward the barrera for a new sword.\n\nRetana’s man handed him the sword over the edge of the barrera.\n\n“Wipe off your face,” he said.\n\nManuel, running again toward the bull, wiped his bloody face with his\nhandkerchief. He had not seen Zurito. Where was Zurito?\n\nThe cuadrilla had stepped away from the bull and waited with their\ncapes. The bull stood, heavy and dull again after the action.\n\nManuel walked toward him with the muleta. He stopped and shook it. The\nbull did not respond. He passed it right and left, left and right before\nthe bull’s muzzle. The bull’s eyes watched it and turned with the swing,\nbut he would not charge. He was waiting for Manuel.\n\nManuel was worried. There was nothing to do but go in. Corto y derecho.\nHe profiled close to the bull, crossed the muleta in front of his body\nand charged. As he pushed in the sword, he jerked his body to the left\nto clear the horn. The bull passed him and the sword shot up in the air,\ntwinkling under the arc-lights, to fall red-hilted on the sand.\n\nManuel ran over and picked it up. It was bent and he straightened it\nover his knee.\n\nAs he came running toward the bull, fixed again now, he passed Hernandez\nstanding with his cape.\n\n“He’s all bone,” the boy said encouragingly.\n\nManuel nodded, wiping his face. He put the bloody handkerchief in his\npocket.\n\nThere was the bull. He was close to the barrera now. Damn him. Maybe he\nwas all bone. Maybe there was not any place for the sword to go in. The\nhell there wasn’t! He’d show them.\n\nHe tried a pass with the muleta and the bull did not move. Manuel\nchopped the muleta back and forth in front of the bull. Nothing doing.\n\nHe furled the muleta, drew the sword out, profiled and drove in on the\nbull. He felt the sword buckle as he shoved it in, leaning his weight on\nit, and then it shot high in the air, end-over-ending into the crowd.\nManuel had jerked clear as the sword jumped."}
{"text": "The first cushions thrown down out of the dark missed him. Then one hit\nhim in the face, his bloody face looking toward the crowd. They were\ncoming down fast. Spotting the sand. Somebody threw an empty\nchampagne-bottle from close range. It hit Manuel on the foot. He stood\nthere watching the dark, where the things were coming from. Then\nsomething whished through the air and struck by him. Manuel leaned over\nand picked it up. It was his sword. He straightened it over his knee and\ngestured with it to the crowd.\n\n“Thank you,” he said. “Thank you.”\n\nOh, the dirty bastards! Dirty bastards! Oh, the lousy, dirty bastards!\nHe kicked into a cushion as he ran.\n\nThere was the bull. The same as ever. All right, you dirty, lousy\nbastard!\n\nManuel passed the muleta in front of the bull’s black muzzle.\n\nNothing doing.\n\nYou won’t! All right. He stepped close and jammed the sharp peak of the\nmuleta into the bull’s damp muzzle.\n\nThe bull was on him as he jumped back and as he tripped on a cushion he\nfelt the horn go into him, into his side. He grabbed the horn with his\ntwo hands and rode backward, holding tight onto the place. The bull\ntossed him and he was clear. He lay still. It was all right. The bull\nwas gone.\n\nHe got up coughing and feeling broken and gone. The dirty bastards!\n\n“Give me the sword,” he shouted. “Give me the stuff.”\n\nFuentes came up with the muleta and the sword.\n\nHernandez put his arm around him.\n\n“Go on to the infirmary, man,” he said. “Don’t be a damn fool.”\n\n“Get away from me,” Manuel said. “Get to hell away from me.”\n\nHe twisted free. Hernandez shrugged his shoulders. Manuel ran toward the\nbull.\n\nThere was the bull standing, heavy, firmly planted.\n\nAll right, you bastard! Manuel drew the sword out of the muleta, sighted\nwith the same movement, and flung himself onto the bull. He felt the\nsword go in all the way. Right up to the guard. Four fingers and his\nthumb into the bull. The blood was hot on his knuckles, and he was on\ntop of the bull.\n\nThe bull lurched with him as he lay on, and seemed to sink; then he was\nstanding clear. He looked at the bull going down slowly over on his\nside, then suddenly four feet in the air.\n\nThen he gestured at the crowd, his hand warm from the bull blood.\n\nAll right, you bastards! He wanted to say something, but he started to\ncough. It was hot and choking. He looked down for the muleta. He must go\nover and salute the president. President hell! He was sitting down\nlooking at something. It was the bull. His four feet up. Thick tongue\nout. Things crawling around on his belly and under his legs. Crawling\nwhere the hair was thin. Dead bull. To hell with the bull! To hell with\nthem all! He started to get to his feet and commenced to cough. He sat\ndown again, coughing. Somebody came and pushed him up.\n\nThey carried him across the ring to the infirmary, running with him\nacross the sand, standing blocked at the gate as the mules came in, then\naround under the dark passageway, men grunting as they took him up the\nstairway, and then laid him down.\n\nThe doctor and two men in white were waiting for him. They laid him out\non the table. They were cutting away his shirt. Manuel felt tired. His\nwhole chest felt scalding inside. He started to cough and they held\nsomething to his mouth. Everybody was very busy.\n\nThere was an electric light in his eyes. He shut his eyes.\n\nHe heard some one coming very heavily up the stairs. Then he did not\nhear it. Then he heard a noise far off. That was the crowd. Well,\nsomebody would have to kill his other bull. They had cut away all his\nshirt. The doctor smiled at him. There was Retana.\n\n“Hello, Retana!” Manuel said. He could not hear his voice.\n\nRetana smiled at him and said something. Manuel could not hear it.\n\nZurito stood beside the table, bending over where the doctor was\nworking. He was in his picador clothes, without his hat.\n\nZurito said something to him. Manuel could not hear it.\n\nZurito was speaking to Retana. One of the men in white smiled and handed\nRetana a pair of scissors. Retana gave them to Zurito. Zurito said\nsomething to Manuel. He could not hear it."}
{"text": "To hell with this operating-table! He’d been on plenty of\noperating-tables before. He was not going to die. There would be a\npriest if he was going to die.\n\nZurito was saying something to him. Holding up the scissors.\n\nThat was it. They were going to cut off his coleta. They were going to\ncut off his pigtail.\n\nManuel sat up on the operating-table. The doctor stepped back, angry.\nSome one grabbed him and held him.\n\n“You couldn’t do a thing like that, Manos,” he said.\n\nHe heard suddenly, clearly, Zurito’s voice.\n\n“That’s all right,” Zurito said. “I won’t do it. I was joking.”\n\n“I was going good,” Manuel said. “I didn’t have any luck. That was all.”\n\nManuel lay back. They had put something over his face. It was all\nfamiliar. He inhaled deeply. He felt very tired. He was very, very\ntired. They took the thing away from his face.\n\n“I was going good,” Manuel said weakly. “I was going great.”\n\nRetana looked at Zurito and started for the door.\n\n“I’ll stay here with him,” Zurito said.\n\nRetana shrugged his shoulders.\n\nManuel opened his eyes and looked at Zurito.\n\n“Wasn’t I going good, Manos?” he asked, for confirmation.\n\n“Sure,” said Zurito. “You were going great.”\n\nThe doctor’s assistant put the cone over Manuel’s face and he inhaled\ndeeply. Zurito stood awkwardly, watching.\n\nIN the fall the war was always there, but we did not go to it any more.\nIt was cold in the fall in Milan and the dark came very early. Then the\nelectric lights came on, and it was pleasant along the streets looking\nin the windows. There was much game hanging outside the shops, and the\nsnow powdered in the fur of the foxes and the wind blew their tails. The\ndeer hung stiff and heavy and empty, and small birds blew in the wind\nand the wind turned their feathers. It was a cold fall and the wind came\ndown from the mountains.\n\nWe were all at the hospital every afternoon, and there were different\nways of walking across the town through the dusk to the hospital. Two of\nthe ways were alongside canals, but they were long. Always, though, you\ncrossed a bridge across a canal to enter the hospital. There was a\nchoice of three bridges. On one of them a woman sold roasted chestnuts.\nIt was warm, standing in front of her charcoal fire, and the chestnuts\nwere warm afterward in your pocket. The hospital was very old and very\nbeautiful, and you entered through a gate and walked across a courtyard\nand out a gate on the other side. There were usually funerals starting\nfrom the courtyard. Beyond the old hospital were the new brick\npavilions, and there we met every afternoon and were all very polite and\ninterested in what was the matter, and sat in the machines that were to\nmake so much difference.\n\nThe doctor came up to the machine where I was sitting and said: “What\ndid you like best to do before the war? Did you practise a sport?”\n\nI said: “Yes, football.”\n\n“Good,” he said. “You will be able to play football again better than\never.”\n\nMy knee did not bend and the leg dropped straight from the knee to the\nankle without a calf, and the machine was to bend the knee and make it\nmove as in riding a tricycle. But it did not bend yet, and instead the\nmachine lurched when it came to the bending part. The doctor said: “That\nwill all pass. You are a fortunate young man. You will play football\nagain like a champion.”\n\nIn the next machine was a major who had a little hand like a baby’s. He\nwinked at me when the doctor examined his hand, which was between two\nleather straps that bounced up and down and flapped the stiff fingers,\nand said: “And will I too play football, captain-doctor?” He had been a\nvery great fencer, and before the war the greatest fencer in Italy.\n\nThe doctor went to his office in a back room and brought a photograph\nwhich showed a hand that had been withered almost as small as the\nmajor’s, before it had taken a machine course, and after was a little\nlarger. The major held the photograph with his good hand and looked at\nit very carefully. “A wound?” he asked.\n\n“An industrial accident,” the doctor said.\n\n“Very interesting, very interesting,” the major said, and handed it back\nto the doctor.\n\n“You have confidence?”\n\n“No,” said the major."}
{"text": "There were three boys who came each day who were about the same age I\nwas. They were all three from Milan, and one of them was to be a lawyer,\nand one was to be a painter, and one had intended to be a soldier, and\nafter we were finished with the machines, sometimes we walked back\ntogether to the Café Cova, which was next door to the Scala. We walked\nthe short way through the communist quarter because we were four\ntogether. The people hated us because we were officers, and from a\nwine-shop some one would call out, “A basso gli ufficiali!” as we\npassed. Another boy who walked with us sometimes and made us five wore a\nblack silk handkerchief across his face because he had no nose then and\nhis face was to be rebuilt. He had gone out to the front from the\nmilitary academy and been wounded within an hour after he had gone into\nthe front line for the first time. They rebuilt his face, but he came\nfrom a very old family and they could never get the nose exactly right.\nHe went to South America and worked in a bank. But this was a long time\nago, and then we did not any of us know how it was going to be\nafterward. We only knew then that there was always the war, but that we\nwere not going to it any more.\n\nWe all had the same medals, except the boy with the black silk bandage\nacross his face, and he had not been at the front long enough to get any\nmedals. The tall boy with a very pale face who was to be a lawyer had\nbeen a lieutenant of Arditi and had three medals of the sort we each had\nonly one of. He had lived a very long time with death and was a little\ndetached. We were all a little detached, and there was nothing that held\nus together except that we met every afternoon at the hospital.\nAlthough, as we walked to the Cova through the tough part of town,\nwalking in the dark, with light and singing coming out of the\nwine-shops, and sometimes having to walk into the street when the men\nand women would crowd together on the sidewalk so that we would have had\nto jostle them to get by, we felt held together by there being something\nthat had happened that they, the people who disliked us, did not\nunderstand.\n\nWe ourselves all understood the Cova, where it was rich and warm and not\ntoo brightly lighted, and noisy and smoky at certain hours, and there\nwere always girls at the tables and the illustrated papers on a rack on\nthe wall. The girls at the Cova were very patriotic, and I found that\nthe most patriotic people in Italy were the café girls—and I believe\nthey are still patriotic.\n\nThe boys at first were very polite about my medals and asked me what I\nhad done to get them. I showed them the papers, which were written in\nvery beautiful language and full of _fratellanza_ and _abnegazione_, but\nwhich really said, with the adjectives removed, that I had been given\nthe medals because I was an American. After that their manner changed a\nlittle toward me, although I was their friend against outsiders. I was a\nfriend, but I was never really one of them after they had read the\ncitations, because it had been different with them and they had done\nvery different things to get their medals. I had been wounded, it was\ntrue; but we all knew that being wounded, after all, was really an\naccident. I was never ashamed of the ribbons, though, and sometimes,\nafter the cocktail hour, I would imagine myself having done all the\nthings they had done to get their medals; but walking home at night\nthrough the empty streets with the cold wind and all the shops closed,\ntrying to keep near the street lights, I knew that I would never have\ndone such things, and I was very much afraid to die, and often lay in\nbed at night by myself, afraid to die and wondering how I would be when\nI went back to the front again."}
{"text": "The three with the medals were like hunting-hawks; and I was not a hawk,\nalthough I might seem a hawk to those who had never hunted; they, the\nthree, knew better and so we drifted apart. But I stayed good friends\nwith the boy who had been wounded his first day at the front, because he\nwould never know now how he would have turned out; so he could never be\naccepted either, and I liked him because I thought perhaps he would not\nhave turned out to be a hawk either.\n\nThe major, who had been the great fencer, did not believe in bravery,\nand spent much time while we sat in the machines correcting my grammar.\nHe had complimented me on how I spoke Italian, and we talked together\nvery easily. One day I had said that Italian seemed such an easy\nlanguage to me that I could not take a great interest in it; everything\nwas so easy to say. “Ah, yes,” the major said. “Why, then, do you not\ntake up the use of grammar?” So we took up the use of grammar, and soon\nItalian was such a difficult language that I was afraid to talk to him\nuntil I had the grammar straight in my mind.\n\nThe major came very regularly to the hospital. I do not think he ever\nmissed a day, although I am sure he did not believe in the machines.\nThere was a time when none of us believed in the machines, and one day\nthe major said it was all nonsense. The machines were new then and it\nwas we who were to prove them. It was an idiotic idea, he said, “a\ntheory, like another.” I had not learned my grammar, and he said I was a\nstupid impossible disgrace, and he was a fool to have bothered with me.\nHe was a small man and he sat straight up in his chair with his right\nhand thrust into the machine and looked straight ahead at the wall while\nthe straps thumped up and down with his fingers in them.\n\n“What will you do when the war is over if it is over?” he asked me.\n“Speak grammatically!”\n\n“I will go to the States.”\n\n“Are you married?”\n\n“No, but I hope to be.”\n\n“The more of a fool you are,” he said. He seemed very angry. “A man must\nnot marry.”\n\n“Why, Signor Maggiore?”\n\n“Don’t call me ‘Signor Maggiore.’”\n\n“Why must not a man marry?”\n\n“He cannot marry. He cannot marry,” he said angrily. “If he is to lose\neverything, he should not place himself in a position to lose that. He\nshould not place himself in a position to lose. He should find things he\ncannot lose.”\n\nHe spoke very angrily and bitterly, and looked straight ahead while he\ntalked.\n\n“But why should he necessarily lose it?”\n\n“He’ll lose it,” the major said. He was looking at the wall. Then he\nlooked down at the machine and jerked his little hand out from between\nthe straps and slapped it hard against his thigh. “He’ll lose it,” he\nalmost shouted. “Don’t argue with me!” Then he called to the attendant\nwho ran the machines. “Come and turn this damned thing off.”\n\nHe went back into the other room for the light treatment and the\nmassage. Then I heard him ask the doctor if he might use his telephone\nand he shut the door. When he came back into the room, I was sitting in\nanother machine. He was wearing his cape and had his cap on, and he came\ndirectly toward my machine and put his arm on my shoulder.\n\n“I am so sorry,” he said, and patted me on the shoulder with his good\nhand. “I would not be rude. My wife has just died. You must forgive me.”\n\n“Oh—” I said, feeling sick for him. “I am _so_ sorry.”\n\nHe stood there biting his lower lip. “It is very difficult,” he said. “I\ncannot resign myself.”\n\nHe looked straight past me and out through the window. Then he began to\ncry. “I am utterly unable to resign myself,” he said and choked. And\nthen crying, his head up looking at nothing, carrying himself straight\nand soldierly, with tears on both his cheeks and biting his lips, he\nwalked past the machines and out the door."}
{"text": "The doctor told me that the major’s wife, who was very young and whom he\nhad not married until he was definitely invalided out of the war, had\ndied of pneumonia. She had been sick only a few days. No one expected\nher to die. The major did not come to the hospital for three days. Then\nhe came at the usual hour, wearing a black band on the sleeve of his\nuniform. When he came back, there were large framed photographs around\nthe wall, of all sorts of wounds before and after they had been cured by\nthe machines. In front of the machine the major used were three\nphotographs of hands like his that were completely restored. I do not\nknow where the doctor got them. I always understood we were the first to\nuse the machines. The photographs did not make much difference to the\nmajor because he only looked out of the window.\n\nTHE hills across the valley of the Ebro were long and white. On this\nside there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two\nlines of rails in the sun. Close against the side of the station there\nwas the warm shadow of the building and a curtain, made of strings of\nbamboo beads, hung across the open door into the bar, to keep out flies.\nThe American and the girl with him sat at a table in the shade, outside\nthe building. It was very hot and the express from Barcelona would come\nin forty minutes. It stopped at this junction for two minutes and went\non to Madrid.\n\n“What should we drink?” the girl asked. She had taken off her hat and\nput it on the table.\n\n“It’s pretty hot,” the man said.\n\n“Let’s drink beer.”\n\n“Dos cervezas,” the man said into the curtain.\n\n“Big ones?” a woman asked from the doorway.\n\n“Yes. Two big ones.”\n\nThe woman brought two glasses of beer and two felt pads. She put the\nfelt pads and the beer glasses on the table and looked at the man and\nthe girl. The girl was looking off at the line of hills. They were white\nin the sun and the country was brown and dry.\n\n“They look like white elephants,” she said.\n\n“I’ve never seen one,” the man drank his beer.\n\n“No, you wouldn’t have.”\n\n“I might have,” the man said. “Just because you say I wouldn’t have\ndoesn’t prove anything.”\n\nThe girl looked at the bead curtain. “They’ve painted something on it,”\nshe said. “What does it say?”\n\n“Anis del Toro. It’s a drink.”\n\n“Could we try it?”\n\nThe man called “Listen” through the curtain. The woman came out from the\nbar.\n\n“Four reales.”\n\n“We want two Anis del Toro.”\n\n“With water?”\n\n“Do you want it with water?”\n\n“I don’t know,” the girl said. “Is it good with water?”\n\n“It’s all right.”\n\n“You want them with water?” asked the woman.\n\n“Yes, with water.”\n\n“It tastes like licorice,” the girl said and put the glass down.\n\n“That’s the way with everything.”\n\n“Yes,” said the girl. “Everything tastes of licorice. Especially all the\nthings you’ve waited so long for, like absinthe.”\n\n“Oh, cut it out.”\n\n“You started it,” the girl said. “I was being amused. I was having a\nfine time.”\n\n“Well, let’s try and have a fine time.”\n\n“All right. I was trying. I said the mountains looked like white\nelephants. Wasn’t that bright?”\n\n“That was bright.”\n\n“I wanted to try this new drink. That’s all we do, isn’t it—look at\nthings and try new drinks?”\n\n“I guess so.”\n\nThe girl looked across at the hills.\n\n“They’re lovely hills,” she said. “They don’t really look like white\nelephants. I just meant the coloring of their skin through the trees.”\n\n“Should we have another drink?”\n\n“All right.”\n\nThe warm wind blew the bead curtain against the table.\n\n“The beer’s nice and cool,” the man said.\n\n“It’s lovely,” the girl said.\n\n“It’s really an awfully simple operation, Jig,” the man said. “It’s not\nreally an operation at all.”\n\nThe girl looked at the ground the table legs rested on.\n\n“I know you wouldn’t mind it, Jig. It’s really not anything. It’s just\nto let the air in.”\n\nThe girl did not say anything.\n\n“I’ll go with you and I’ll stay with you all the time. They just let the\nair in and then it’s all perfectly natural.”\n\n“Then what will we do afterward?”\n\n“We’ll be fine afterward. Just like we were before.”\n\n“What makes you think so?”\n\n“That’s the only thing that bothers us. It’s the only thing that’s made\nus unhappy.”\n\nThe girl looked at the bead curtain, put her hand out and took hold of\ntwo of the strings of beads."}
{"text": "“And you think then we’ll be all right and be happy.”\n\n“I know we will. You don’t have to be afraid. I’ve known lots of people\nthat have done it.”\n\n“So have I,” said the girl. “And afterward they were all so happy.”\n\n“Well,” the man said, “if you don’t want to you don’t have to. I\nwouldn’t have you do it if you didn’t want to. But I know it’s perfectly\nsimple.”\n\n“And you really want to?”\n\n“I think it’s the best thing to do. But I don’t want you to do it if you\ndon’t really want to.”\n\n“And if I do it you’ll be happy and things will be like they were and\nyou’ll love me?”\n\n“I love you now. You know I love you.”\n\n“I know. But if I do it, then it will be nice again if I say things are\nlike white elephants, and you’ll like it?”\n\n“I’ll love it. I love it now but I just can’t think about it. You know\nhow I get when I worry.”\n\n“If I do it you won’t ever worry?”\n\n“I won’t worry about that because it’s perfectly simple.”\n\n“Then I’ll do it. Because I don’t care about me.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I don’t care about me.”\n\n“Well, I care about you.”\n\n“Oh, yes. But I don’t care about me. And I’ll do it and then everything\nwill be fine.”\n\n“I don’t want you to do it if you feel that way.”\n\nThe girl stood up and walked to the end of the station. Across, on the\nother side, were fields of grain and trees along the banks of the Ebro.\nFar away, beyond the river, were mountains. The shadow of a cloud moved\nacross the field of grain and she saw the river through the trees.\n\n“And we could have all this,” she said. “And we could have everything\nand every day we make it more impossible.”\n\n“What did you say?”\n\n“I said we could have everything.”\n\n“We can have everything.”\n\n“No, we can’t.”\n\n“We can have the whole world.”\n\n“No, we can’t.”\n\n“We can go everywhere.”\n\n“No, we can’t. It isn’t ours any more.”\n\n“It’s ours.”\n\n“No, it isn’t. And once they take it away, you never get it back.”\n\n“But they haven’t taken it away.”\n\n“We’ll wait and see.”\n\n“Come on back in the shade,” he said. “You mustn’t feel that way.”\n\n“I don’t feel any way,” the girl said. “I just know things.”\n\n“I don’t want you to do anything that you don’t want to do——”\n\n“Nor that isn’t good for me,” she said. “I know. Could we have another\nbeer?”\n\n“All right. But you’ve got to realize——”\n\n“I realize,” the girl said. “Can’t we maybe stop talking?”\n\nThey sat down at the table and the girl looked across at the hills on\nthe dry side of the valley and the man looked at her and at the table.\n\n“You’ve got to realize,” he said, “that I don’t want you to do it if you\ndon’t want to. I’m perfectly willing to go through with it if it means\nanything to you.”\n\n“Doesn’t it mean anything to you? We could get along.”\n\n“Of course it does. But I don’t want anybody but you. I don’t want any\none else. And I know it’s perfectly simple.”\n\n“Yes, you know it’s perfectly simple.”\n\n“It’s all right for you to say that, but I do know it.”\n\n“Would you do something for me now?”\n\n“I’d do anything for you.”\n\n“Would you please please please please please please please stop\ntalking?”\n\nHe did not say anything but looked at the bags against the wall of the\nstation. There were labels on them from all the hotels where they had\nspent nights.\n\n“But I don’t want you to,” he said, “I don’t care anything about it.”\n\n“I’ll scream,” the girl said.\n\nThe woman came out through the curtains with two glasses of beer and put\nthem down on the damp felt pads. “The train comes in five minutes,” she\nsaid.\n\n“What did she say?” asked the girl.\n\n“That the train is coming in five minutes.”\n\nThe girl smiled brightly at the woman, to thank her.\n\n“I’d better take the bags over to the other side of the station,” the\nman said. She smiled at him.\n\n“All right. Then come back and we’ll finish the beer.”\n\nHe picked up the two heavy bags and carried them around the station to\nthe other tracks. He looked up the tracks but could not see the train.\nComing back, he walked through the barroom, where people waiting for the\ntrain were drinking. He drank an Anis at the bar and looked at the\npeople. They were all waiting reasonably for the train. He went out\nthrough the bead curtain. She was sitting at the table and smiled at\nhim.\n\n“Do you feel better?” he asked.\n\n“I feel fine,” she said. “There’s nothing wrong with me. I feel fine.”"}
{"text": "THE door of Henry’s lunch-room opened and two men came in. They sat down\nat the counter.\n\n“What’s yours?” George asked them.\n\n“I don’t know,” one of the men said. “What do you want to eat, Al?”\n\n“I don’t know,” said Al. “I don’t know what I want to eat.”\n\nOutside it was getting dark. The street-light came on outside the\nwindow. The two men at the counter read the menu. From the other end of\nthe counter Nick Adams watched them. He had been talking to George when\nthey came in.\n\n“I’ll have a roast pork tenderloin with apple sauce and mashed\npotatoes,” the first man said.\n\n“It isn’t ready yet.”\n\n“What the hell do you put it on the card for?”\n\n“That’s the dinner,” George explained. “You can get that at six\no’clock.”\n\nGeorge looked at the clock on the wall behind the counter.\n\n“It’s five o’clock.”\n\n“The clock says twenty minutes past five,” the second man said.\n\n“It’s twenty minutes fast.”\n\n“Oh, to hell with the clock,” the first man said. “What have you got to\neat?”\n\n“I can give you any kind of sandwiches,” George said. “You can have ham\nand eggs, bacon and eggs, liver and bacon, or a steak.”\n\n“Give me chicken croquettes with green peas and cream sauce and mashed\npotatoes.”\n\n“That’s the dinner.”\n\n“Everything we want’s the dinner, eh? That’s the way you work it.”\n\n“I can give you ham and eggs, bacon and eggs, liver——”\n\n“I’ll take ham and eggs,” the man called Al said. He wore a derby hat\nand a black overcoat buttoned across the chest. His face was small and\nwhite and he had tight lips. He wore a silk muffler and gloves.\n\n“Give me bacon and eggs,” said the other man. He was about the same size\nas Al. Their faces were different, but they were dressed like twins.\nBoth wore overcoats too tight for them. They sat leaning forward, their\nelbows on the counter.\n\n“Got anything to drink?” Al asked.\n\n“Silver beer, bevo, ginger-ale,” George said.\n\n“I mean you got anything to _drink_?”\n\n“Just those I said.”\n\n“This is a hot town,” said the other. “What do they call it?”\n\n“Summit.”\n\n“Ever hear of it?” Al asked his friend.\n\n“No,” said the friend.\n\n“What do you do here nights?” Al asked.\n\n“They eat the dinner,” his friend said. “They all come here and eat the\nbig dinner.”\n\n“That’s right,” George said.\n\n“So you think that’s right?” Al asked George.\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“You’re a pretty bright boy, aren’t you?”\n\n“Sure,” said George.\n\n“Well, you’re not,” said the other little man. “Is he, Al?”\n\n“He’s dumb,” said Al. He turned to Nick. “What’s your name?”\n\n“Adams.”\n\n“Another bright boy,” Al said. “Ain’t he a bright boy, Max?”\n\n“The town’s full of bright boys,” Max said.\n\nGeorge put the two platters, one of ham and eggs, the other of bacon and\neggs, on the counter. He set down two side-dishes of fried potatoes and\nclosed the wicket into the kitchen.\n\n“Which is yours?” he asked Al.\n\n“Don’t you remember?”\n\n“Ham and eggs.”\n\n“Just a bright boy,” Max said. He leaned forward and took the ham and\neggs. Both men ate with their gloves on. George watched them eat.\n\n“What are _you_ looking at?” Max looked at George.\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“The hell you were. You were looking at me.”\n\n“Maybe the boy meant it for a joke, Max,” Al said.\n\nGeorge laughed.\n\n“_You_ don’t have to laugh,” Max said to him. “_You_ don’t have to laugh\nat all, see?”\n\n“All right,” said George.\n\n“So he thinks it’s all right.” Max turned to Al. “He thinks it’s all\nright. That’s a good one.”\n\n“Oh, he’s a thinker,” Al said. They went on eating.\n\n“What’s the bright boy’s name down the counter?” Al asked Max.\n\n“Hey, bright boy,” Max said to Nick. “You go around on the other side of\nthe counter with your boy friend.”\n\n“What’s the idea?” Nick asked.\n\n“There isn’t any idea.”\n\n“You better go around, bright boy,” Al said. Nick went around behind the\ncounter.\n\n“What’s the idea?” George asked.\n\n“None of your damn business,” Al said. “Who’s out in the kitchen?”\n\n“The nigger.”\n\n“What do you mean the nigger?”\n\n“The nigger that cooks.”\n\n“Tell him to come in.”\n\n“What’s the idea?”\n\n“Tell him to come in.”\n\n“Where do you think you are?”\n\n“We know damn well where we are,” the man called Max said. “Do we look\nsilly?”\n\n“You talk silly,” Al said to him. “What the hell do you argue with this\nkid for? Listen,” he said to George, “tell the nigger to come out here.”\n\n“What are you going to do to him?”\n\n“Nothing. Use your head, bright boy. What would we do to a nigger?”"}
{"text": "George opened the slit that opened back into the kitchen. “Sam,” he\ncalled. “Come in here a minute.”\n\nThe door to the kitchen opened and the nigger came in. “What was it?” he\nasked. The two men at the counter took a look at him.\n\n“All right, nigger. You stand right there,” Al said.\n\nSam, the nigger, standing in his apron, looked at the two men sitting at\nthe counter. “Yes, sir,” he said. Al got down from his stool.\n\n“I’m going back to the kitchen with the nigger and bright boy,” he said.\n“Go on back to the kitchen, nigger. You go with him, bright boy.” The\nlittle man walked after Nick and Sam, the cook, back into the kitchen.\nThe door shut after them. The man called Max sat at the counter opposite\nGeorge. He didn’t look at George but looked in the mirror that ran along\nback of the counter. Henry’s had been made over from a saloon into a\nlunch-counter.\n\n“Well, bright boy,” Max said, looking into the mirror, “why don’t you\nsay something?”\n\n“What’s it all about?”\n\n“Hey, Al,” Max called, “bright boy wants to know what it’s all about.”\n\n“Why don’t you tell him?” Al’s voice came from the kitchen.\n\n“What do you think it’s all about?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“What do you think?”\n\nMax looked into the mirror all the time he was talking.\n\n“I wouldn’t say.”\n\n“Hey, Al, bright boy says he wouldn’t say what he thinks it’s all\nabout.”\n\n“I can hear you, all right,” Al said from the kitchen. He had propped\nopen the slit that dishes passed through into the kitchen with a catsup\nbottle. “Listen, bright boy,” he said from the kitchen to George. “Stand\na little further along the bar. You move a little to the left, Max.” He\nwas like a photographer arranging for a group picture.\n\n“Talk to me, bright boy,” Max said. “What do you think’s going to\nhappen?”\n\nGeorge did not say anything.\n\n“I’ll tell you,” Max said. “We’re going to kill a Swede. Do you know a\nbig Swede named Ole Andreson?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“He comes here to eat every night, don’t he?”\n\n“Sometimes he comes here.”\n\n“He comes here at six o’clock, don’t he?”\n\n“If he comes.”\n\n“We know all that, bright boy,” Max said. “Talk about something else.\nEver go to the movies?”\n\n“Once in a while.”\n\n“You ought to go to the movies more. The movies are fine for a bright\nboy like you.”\n\n“What are you going to kill Ole Andreson for? What did he ever do to\nyou?”\n\n“He never had a chance to do anything to us. He never even seen us.”\n\n“And he’s only going to see us once,” Al said from the kitchen.\n\n“What are you going to kill him for, then?” George asked.\n\n“We’re killing him for a friend. Just to oblige a friend, bright boy.”\n\n“Shut up,” said Al from the kitchen. “You talk too goddam much.”\n\n“Well, I got to keep bright boy amused. Don’t I, bright boy?”\n\n“You talk too damn much,” Al said. “The nigger and my bright boy are\namused by themselves. I got them tied up like a couple of girl friends\nin the convent.”\n\n“I suppose you were in a convent.”\n\n“You never know.”\n\n“You were in a kosher convent. That’s where you were.”\n\nGeorge looked up at the clock.\n\n“If anybody comes in you tell them the cook is off, and if they keep\nafter it, you tell them you’ll go back and cook yourself. Do you get\nthat, bright boy?”\n\n“All right,” George said. “What you going to do with us afterward?”\n\n“That’ll depend,” Max said. “That’s one of those things you never know\nat the time.”\n\nGeorge looked up at the clock. It was a quarter past six. The door from\nthe street opened. A street-car motorman came in.\n\n“Hello, George,” he said. “Can I get supper?”\n\n“Sam’s gone out,” George said. “He’ll be back in about half an hour.”\n\n“I’d better go up the street,” the motorman said. George looked at the\nclock. It was twenty minutes past six.\n\n“That was nice, bright boy,” Max said. “You’re a regular little\ngentleman.”\n\n“He knew I’d blow his head off,” Al said from the kitchen.\n\n“No,” said Max. “It ain’t that. Bright boy is nice. He’s a nice boy. I\nlike him.”\n\nAt six-fifty-five George said: “He’s not coming.”"}
{"text": "Two other people had been in the lunch-room. Once George had gone out to\nthe kitchen and made a ham-and-egg sandwich “to go” that a man wanted to\ntake with him. Inside the kitchen he saw Al, his derby hat tipped back,\nsitting on a stool beside the wicket with the muzzle of a sawed-off\nshotgun resting on the ledge. Nick and the cook were back to back in the\ncorner, a towel tied in each of their mouths. George had cooked the\nsandwich, wrapped it up in oiled paper, put it in a bag, brought it in,\nand the man had paid for it and gone out.\n\n“Bright boy can do everything,” Max said. “He can cook and everything.\nYou’d make some girl a nice wife, bright boy.”\n\n“Yes?” George said. “Your friend, Ole Andreson, isn’t going to come.”\n\n“We’ll give him ten minutes,” Max said.\n\nMax watched the mirror and the clock. The hands of the clock marked\nseven o’clock, and then five minutes past seven.\n\n“Come on, Al,” said Max. “We better go. He’s not coming.”\n\n“Better give him five minutes,” Al said from the kitchen.\n\nIn the five minutes a man came in, and George explained that the cook\nwas sick.\n\n“Why the hell don’t you get another cook?” the man asked. “Aren’t you\nrunning a lunch-counter?” He went out.\n\n“Come on, Al,” Max said.\n\n“What about the two bright boys and the nigger?”\n\n“They’re all right.”\n\n“You think so?”\n\n“Sure. We’re through with it.”\n\n“I don’t like it,” said Al. “It’s sloppy. You talk too much.”\n\n“Oh, what the hell,” said Max. “We got to keep amused, haven’t we?”\n\n“You talk too much, all the same,” Al said. He came out from the\nkitchen. The cut-off barrels of the shotgun made a slight bulge under\nthe waist of his too tight-fitting overcoat. He straightened his coat\nwith his gloved hands.\n\n“So long, bright boy,” he said to George. “You got a lot of luck.”\n\n“That’s the truth,” Max said. “You ought to play the races, bright boy.”\n\nThe two of them went out the door. George watched them, through the\nwindow, pass under the arc-light and cross the street. In their tight\novercoats and derby hats they looked like a vaudeville team. George went\nback through the swinging-door into the kitchen and untied Nick and the\ncook.\n\n“I don’t want any more of that,” said Sam, the cook. “I don’t want any\nmore of that.”\n\nNick stood up. He had never had a towel in his mouth before.\n\n“Say,” he said. “What the hell?” He was trying to swagger it off.\n\n“They were going to kill Ole Andreson,” George said. “They were going to\nshoot him when he came in to eat.”\n\n“Ole Andreson?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\nThe cook felt the corners of his mouth with his thumbs.\n\n“They all gone?” he asked.\n\n“Yeah,” said George. “They’re gone now.”\n\n“I don’t like it,” said the cook. “I don’t like any of it at all.”\n\n“Listen,” George said to Nick. “You better go see Ole Andreson.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“You better not have anything to do with it at all,” Sam, the cook,\nsaid. “You better stay way out of it.”\n\n“Don’t go if you don’t want to,” George said.\n\n“Mixing up in this ain’t going to get you anywhere,” the cook said. “You\nstay out of it.”\n\n“I’ll go see him,” Nick said to George. “Where does he live?”\n\nThe cook turned away.\n\n“Little boys always know what they want to do,” he said.\n\n“He lives up at Hirsch’s rooming-house,” George said to Nick.\n\n“I’ll go up there.”\n\nOutside the arc-light shone through the bare branches of a tree. Nick\nwalked up the street beside the car-tracks and turned at the next\narc-light down a side-street. Three houses up the street was Hirsch’s\nrooming-house. Nick walked up the two steps and pushed the bell. A woman\ncame to the door.\n\n“Is Ole Andreson here?”\n\n“Do you want to see him?”\n\n“Yes, if he’s in.”\n\nNick followed the woman up a flight of stairs and back to the end of a\ncorridor. She knocked on the door.\n\n“Who is it?”\n\n“It’s somebody to see you, Mr. Andreson,” the woman said.\n\n“It’s Nick Adams.”\n\n“Come in.”\n\nNick opened the door and went into the room. Ole Andreson was lying on\nthe bed with all his clothes on. He had been a heavyweight prizefighter\nand he was too long for the bed. He lay with his head on two pillows. He\ndid not look at Nick.\n\n“What was it?” he asked.\n\n“I was up at Henry’s,” Nick said, “and two fellows came in and tied up\nme and the cook, and they said they were going to kill you.”"}
{"text": "It sounded silly when he said it. Ole Andreson said nothing.\n\n“They put us out in the kitchen,” Nick went on. “They were going to\nshoot you when you came in to supper.”\n\nOle Andreson looked at the wall and did not say anything.\n\n“George thought I better come and tell you about it.”\n\n“There isn’t anything I can do about it,” Ole Andreson said.\n\n“I’ll tell you what they were like.”\n\n“I don’t want to know what they were like,” Ole Andreson said. He looked\nat the wall. “Thanks for coming to tell me about it.”\n\n“That’s all right.”\n\nNick looked at the big man lying on the bed.\n\n“Don’t you want me to go and see the police?”\n\n“No,” Ole Andreson said. “That wouldn’t do any good.”\n\n“Isn’t there something I could do?”\n\n“No. There ain’t anything to do.”\n\n“Maybe it was just a bluff.”\n\n“No. It ain’t just a bluff.”\n\nOle Andreson rolled over toward the wall.\n\n“The only thing is,” he said, talking toward the wall, “I just can’t\nmake up my mind to go out. I been in here all day.”\n\n“Couldn’t you get out of town?”\n\n“No,” Ole Andreson said. “I’m through with all that running around.”\n\nHe looked at the wall.\n\n“There ain’t anything to do now.”\n\n“Couldn’t you fix it up some way?”\n\n“No. I got in wrong.” He talked in the same flat voice. “There ain’t\nanything to do. After a while I’ll make up my mind to go out.”\n\n“I better go back and see George,” Nick said.\n\n“So long,” said Ole Andreson. He did not look toward Nick. “Thanks for\ncoming around.”\n\nNick went out. As he shut the door he saw Ole Andreson with all his\nclothes on, lying on the bed looking at the wall.\n\n“He’s been in his room all day,” the landlady said downstairs. “I guess\nhe don’t feel well. I said to him: ‘Mr. Andreson, you ought to go out\nand take a walk on a nice fall day like this,’ but he didn’t feel like\nit.”\n\n“He doesn’t want to go out.”\n\n“I’m sorry he don’t feel well,” the woman said. “He’s an awfully nice\nman. He was in the ring, you know.”\n\n“I know it.”\n\n“You’d never know it except from the way his face is,” the woman said.\nThey stood talking just inside the street door. “He’s just as gentle.”\n\n“Well, good-night, Mrs. Hirsch,” Nick said.\n\n“I’m not Mrs. Hirsch,” the woman said. “She owns the place. I just look\nafter it for her. I’m Mrs. Bell.”\n\n“Well, good-night, Mrs. Bell,” Nick said.\n\n“Good-night,” the woman said.\n\nNick walked up the dark street to the corner under the arc-light, and\nthen along the car-tracks to Henry’s eating-house. George was inside,\nback of the counter.\n\n“Did you see Ole?”\n\n“Yes,” said Nick. “He’s in his room and he won’t go out.”\n\nThe cook opened the door from the kitchen when he heard Nick’s voice.\n\n“I don’t even listen to it,” he said and shut the door.\n\n“Did you tell him about it?” George asked.\n\n“Sure. I told him but he knows what it’s all about.”\n\n“What’s he going to do?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“They’ll kill him.”\n\n“I guess they will.”\n\n“He must have got mixed up in something in Chicago.”\n\n“I guess so,” said Nick.\n\n“It’s a hell of a thing.”\n\n“It’s an awful thing,” Nick said.\n\nThey did not say anything. George reached down for a towel and wiped the\ncounter.\n\n“I wonder what he did?” Nick said.\n\n“Double-crossed somebody. That’s what they kill them for.”\n\n“I’m going to get out of this town,” Nick said.\n\n“Yes,” said George. “That’s a good thing to do.”\n\n“I can’t stand to think about him waiting in the room and knowing he’s\ngoing to get it. It’s too damned awful.”\n\n“Well,” said George, “you better not think about it.”\n\nCHE TI DICE LA PATRIA?\n\nTHE road of the pass was hard and smooth and not yet dusty in the early\nmorning. Below were the hills with oak and chestnut trees, and far away\nbelow was the sea. On the other side were snowy mountains.\n\nWe came down from the pass through wooded country. There were bags of\ncharcoal piled beside the road, and through the trees we saw\ncharcoal-burners’ huts. It was Sunday and the road, rising and falling,\nbut always dropping away from the altitude of the pass, went through the\nscrub woods and through villages."}
{"text": "Outside the villages there were fields with vines. The fields were brown\nand the vines coarse and thick. The houses were white, and in the\nstreets the men, in their Sunday clothes, were playing bowls. Against\nthe walls of some of the houses there were pear trees, their branches\ncandelabraed against the white walls. The pear trees had been sprayed,\nand the walls of the houses were stained a metallic blue-green by the\nspray vapor. There were small clearings around the villages where the\nvines grew, and then the woods.\n\nIn a village, twenty kilometres above Spezia, there was a crowd in the\nsquare, and a young man carrying a suitcase came up to the car and asked\nus to take him in to Spezia.\n\n“There are only two places, and they are occupied,” I said. We had an\nold Ford coupé.\n\n“I will ride on the outside.”\n\n“You will be uncomfortable.”\n\n“That makes nothing. I must go to Spezia.”\n\n“Should we take him?” I asked Guy.\n\n“He seems to be going anyway,” Guy said. The young man handed in a\nparcel through the window.\n\n“Look after this,” he said. Two men tied his suitcase on the back of the\ncar, above our suitcases. He shook hands with every one, explained that\nto a Fascist and a man as used to travelling as himself there was no\ndiscomfort, and climbed up on the running-board on the left-hand side of\nthe car, holding on inside, his right arm through the open window.\n\n“You can start,” he said. The crowd waved. He waved with his free hand.\n\n“What did he say?” Guy asked me.\n\n“That we could start.”\n\n“Isn’t he nice?” Guy said.\n\nThe road followed a river. Across the river were mountains. The sun was\ntaking the frost out of the grass. It was bright and cold and the air\ncame cold through the open wind-shield.\n\n“How do you think he likes it out there?” Guy was looking up the road.\nHis view out of his side of the car was blocked by our guest. The young\nman projected from the side of the car like the figurehead of a ship. He\nhad turned his coat collar up and pulled his hat down and his nose\nlooked cold in the wind.\n\n“Maybe he’ll get enough of it,” Guy said. “That’s the side our bum\ntire’s on.”\n\n“Oh, he’d leave us if we blew out,” I said. “He wouldn’t get his\ntravelling-clothes dirty.”\n\n“Well, I don’t mind him,” Guy said—“except the way he leans out on the\nturns.”\n\nThe woods were gone; the road had left the river to climb; the radiator\nwas boiling; the young man looked annoyedly and suspiciously at the\nsteam and rusty water; the engine was grinding, with both Guy’s feet on\nthe first-speed pedal, up and up, back and forth and up, and, finally,\nout level. The grinding stopped, and in the new quiet there was a great\nchurning bubbling in the radiator. We were at the top of the last range\nabove Spezia and the sea. The road descended with short, barely rounded\nturns. Our guest hung out on the turns and nearly pulled the top-heavy\ncar over.\n\n“You can’t tell him not to,” I said to Guy. “It’s his sense of\nself-preservation.”\n\n“The great Italian sense.”\n\n“The greatest Italian sense.”\n\nWe came down around curves, through deep dust, the dust powdering the\nolive trees. Spezia spread below along the sea. The road flattened\noutside the town. Our guest put his head in the window.\n\n“I want to stop.”\n\n“Stop it,” I said to Guy.\n\nWe slowed up, at the side of the road. The young man got down, went to\nthe back of the car and untied the suitcase.\n\n“I stop here, so you won’t get into trouble carrying passengers,” he\nsaid. “My package.”\n\nI handed him the package. He reached in his pocket.\n\n“How much do I owe you?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I said.\n\n“Then thanks,” the young man said, not “thank you,” or “thank you very\nmuch,” or “thank you a thousand times,” all of which you formerly said\nin Italy to a man when he handed you a time-table or explained about a\ndirection. The young man uttered the lowest form of the word “thanks”\nand looked after us suspiciously as Guy started the car. I waved my hand\nat him. He was too dignified to reply. We went on into Spezia.\n\n“That’s a young man that will go a long way in Italy,” I said to Guy.\n\n“Well,” said Guy, “he went twenty kilometres with us.”"}
{"text": "We came into Spezia looking for a place to eat. The street was wide and\nthe houses high and yellow. We followed the tram-track into the centre\nof town. On the walls of the houses were stencilled eye-bugging\nportraits of Mussolini, with hand-painted “vivas,” the double V in black\npaint with drippings of paint down the wall. Side-streets went down to\nthe harbor. It was bright and the people were all out for Sunday. The\nstone paving had been sprinkled and there were damp stretches in the\ndust. We went close to the curb to avoid a tram.\n\n“Let’s eat somewhere simple,” Guy said.\n\nWe stopped opposite two restaurant signs. We were standing across the\nstreet and I was buying the papers. The two restaurants were side by\nside. A woman standing in the doorway of one smiled at us and we crossed\nthe street and went in.\n\nIt was dark inside and at the back of the room three girls were sitting\nat a table with an old woman. Across from us, at another table, sat a\nsailor. He sat there neither eating nor drinking. Further back, a young\nman in a blue suit was writing at a table. His hair was pomaded and\nshining and he was very smartly dressed and clean-cut looking.\n\nThe light came through the doorway, and through the window where\nvegetables, fruit, steaks, and chops were arranged in a show-case. A\ngirl came and took our order and another girl stood in the doorway. We\nnoticed that she wore nothing under her house dress. The girl who took\nour order put her arm around Guy’s neck while we were looking at the\nmenu. There were three girls in all, and they all took turns going and\nstanding in the doorway. The old woman at the table in the back of the\nroom spoke to them and they sat down again with her.\n\nThere was no doorway leading from the room except into the kitchen. A\ncurtain hung over it. The girl who had taken our order came in from the\nkitchen with spaghetti. She put it on the table and brought a bottle of\nred wine and sat down at the table.\n\n“Well,” I said to Guy, “you wanted to eat some place simple.”\n\n“This isn’t simple. This is complicated.”\n\n“What do you say?” asked the girl. “Are you Germans?”\n\n“South Germans,” I said. “The South Germans are a gentle, lovable\npeople.”\n\n“Don’t understand,” she said.\n\n“What’s the mechanics of this place?” Guy asked. “Do I have to let her\nput her arm around my neck?”\n\n“Certainly,” I said. “Mussolini has abolished the brothels. This is a\nrestaurant.”\n\nThe girl wore a one-piece dress. She leaned forward against the table\nand put her hands on her breasts and smiled. She smiled better on one\nside than on the other and turned the good side toward us. The charm of\nthe good side had been enhanced by some event which had smoothed the\nother side of her nose in, as warm wax can be smoothed. Her nose,\nhowever, did not look like warm wax. It was very cold and firmed, only\nsmoothed in. “You like me?” she asked Guy.\n\n“He adores you,” I said. “But he doesn’t speak Italian.”\n\n“Ich spreche Deutsch,” she said, and stroked Guy’s hair.\n\n“Speak to the lady in your native tongue, Guy.”\n\n“Where do you come from?” asked the lady.\n\n“Potsdam.”\n\n“And you will stay here now for a little while?”\n\n“In this so dear Spezia?” I asked.\n\n“Tell her we have to go,” said Guy. “Tell her we are very ill, and have\nno money.”\n\n“My friend is a misogynist,” I said, “an old German misogynist.”\n\n“Tell him I love him.”\n\nI told him.\n\n“Will you shut your mouth and get us out of here?” Guy said. The lady\nhad placed another arm around his neck. “Tell him he is mine,” she said.\nI told him.\n\n“Will you get us out of here?”\n\n“You are quarrelling,” the lady said. “You do not love one another.”\n\n“We are Germans,” I said proudly, “old South Germans.”\n\n“Tell him he is a beautiful boy,” the lady said. Guy is thirty-eight and\ntakes some pride in the fact that he is taken for a travelling salesman\nin France. “You are a beautiful boy,” I said.\n\n“Who says so?” Guy asked, “you or her?”\n\n“She does. I’m just your interpreter. Isn’t that what you got me in on\nthis trip for?”\n\n“I’m glad it’s her,” said Guy. “I didn’t want to have to leave you here\ntoo.”\n\n“I don’t know. Spezia’s a lovely place.”\n\n“Spezia,” the lady said. “You are talking about Spezia.”\n\n“Lovely place,” I said."}
{"text": "“It is my country,” she said. “Spezia is my home and Italy is my\ncountry.”\n\n“She says that Italy is her country.”\n\n“Tell her it looks like her country,” Guy said.\n\n“What have you for dessert?” I asked.\n\n“Fruit,” she said. “We have bananas.”\n\n“Bananas are all right,” Guy said. “They’ve got skins on.”\n\n“Oh, he takes bananas,” the lady said. She embraced Guy.\n\n“What does she say?” he asked, keeping his face out of the way.\n\n“She is pleased because you take bananas.”\n\n“Tell her I don’t take bananas.”\n\n“The Signor does not take bananas.”\n\n“Ah,” said the lady, crestfallen, “he doesn’t take bananas.”\n\n“Tell her I take a cold bath every morning,” Guy said.\n\n“The Signor takes a cold bath every morning.”\n\n“No understand,” the lady said.\n\nAcross from us, the property sailor had not moved. No one in the place\npaid any attention to him.\n\n“We want the bill,” I said.\n\n“Oh, no. You must stay.”\n\n“Listen,” the clean-cut young man said from the table where he was\nwriting, “let them go. These two are worth nothing.”\n\nThe lady took my hand. “You won’t stay? You won’t ask him to stay?”\n\n“We have to go,” I said. “We have to get to Pisa, or if possible,\nFirenze, to-night. We can amuse ourselves in those cities at the end of\nthe day. It is now the day. In the day we must cover distance.”\n\n“To stay a little while is nice.”\n\n“To travel is necessary during the light of day.”\n\n“Listen,” the clean-cut young man said. “Don’t bother to talk with these\ntwo. I tell you they are worth nothing and I know.”\n\n“Bring us the bill,” I said. She brought the bill from the old woman and\nwent back and sat at the table. Another girl came in from the kitchen.\nShe walked the length of the room and stood in the doorway.\n\n“Don’t bother with these two,” the clean-cut young man said in a wearied\nvoice. “Come and eat. They are worth nothing.”\n\nWe paid the bill and stood up. All the girls, the old woman, and the\nclean-cut young man sat down at table together. The property sailor sat\nwith his head in his hands. No one had spoken to him all the time we\nwere at lunch. The girl brought us our change that the old woman counted\nout for her and went back to her place at the table. We left a tip on\nthe table and went out. When we were seated in the car ready to start,\nthe girl came out and stood in the door. We started and I waved to her.\nShe did not wave, but stood there looking after us.\n\nIt was raining hard when we passed through the suburbs of Genoa and,\neven going very slowly behind the tram-cars and the motor trucks, liquid\nmud splashed on to the sidewalks, so that people stepped into doorways\nas they saw us coming. In San Pier d’Arena, the industrial suburb\noutside of Genoa, there is a wide street with two car-tracks and we\ndrove down the centre to avoid sending the mud on to the men going home\nfrom work. On our left was the Mediterranean. There was a big sea\nrunning and waves broke and the wind blew the spray against the car. A\nriver-bed that, when we had passed, going into Italy, had been wide,\nstony and dry, was running brown, and up to the banks. The brown water\ndiscolored the sea and as the waves thinned and cleared in breaking, the\nlight came through the yellow water and the crests, detached by the\nwind, blew across the road.\n\nA big car passed us, going fast, and a sheet of muddy water rose up and\nover our wind-shield and radiator. The automatic wind-shield cleaner\nmoved back and forth, spreading the film over the glass. We stopped and\nate lunch at Sestri. There was no heat in the restaurant and we kept our\nhats and coats on. We could see the car outside, through the window. It\nwas covered with mud and was stopped beside some boats that had been\npulled up beyond the waves. In the restaurant you could see your breath."}
{"text": "The _pasta asciuta_ was good; the wine tasted of alum, and we poured\nwater in it. Afterward the waiter brought beefsteak and fried potatoes.\nA man and a woman sat at the far end of the restaurant. He was\nmiddle-aged and she was young and wore black. All during the meal she\nwould blow out her breath in the cold damp air. The man would look at it\nand shake his head. They ate without talking and the man held her hand\nunder the table. She was good-looking and they seemed very sad. They had\na travelling-bag with them.\n\n“Although I don’t know how, me not being a plumber, they expected me to\nsteal anything,” Guy said.\n\nAs we came up on a headland beyond the town, the wind struck the car and\nnearly tipped it over.\n\n“It’s good it blows us away from the sea,” Guy said.\n\n“Well,” I said, “they drowned Shelley somewhere along here.”\n\n“That was down by Viareggio,” Guy said. “Do you remember what we came to\nthis country for?”\n\n“Yes,” I said, “but we didn’t get it.”\n\n“We’ll be out of it to-night.”\n\n“If we can get past Ventimiglia.”\n\n“We’ll see. I don’t like to drive this coast at night.” It was early\nafternoon and the sun was out. Below, the sea was blue with whitecaps\nrunning toward Savona. Back, beyond the cape, the brown and blue waters\njoined. Out ahead of us, a tramp steamer was going up the coast.\n\n“Can you still see Genoa?” Guy asked.\n\n“Oh, yes.”\n\n“That next big cape ought to put it out of sight.”\n\n“We’ll see it a long time yet. I can still see Portofino Cape behind\nit.”\n\nFinally we could not see Genoa. I looked back as we came out and there\nwas only the sea, and below in the bay, a line of beach with\nfishing-boats and above, on the side of the hill, a town and then capes\nfar down the coast.\n\n“It’s gone now,” I said to Guy.\n\n“Oh, it’s been gone a long time now.”\n\n“But we couldn’t be sure till we got way out.”\n\nThere was a sign with a picture of an S-turn and Svolta Pericolosa. The\nroad curved around the headland and the wind blew through the crack in\nthe wind-shield. Below the cape was a flat stretch beside the sea. The\nwind had dried the mud and the wheels were beginning to lift dust. On\nthe flat road we passed a Fascist riding a bicycle, a heavy revolver in\na holster on his back. He held the middle of the road on his bicycle and\nwe turned out for him. He looked up at us as we passed. Ahead there was\na railway crossing, and as we came toward it the gates went down.\n\nAs we waited, the Fascist came up on his bicycle. The train went by and\nGuy started the engine.\n\n“Wait,” the bicycle man shouted from behind the car. “Your number’s\ndirty.”\n\nI got out with a rag. The number had been cleaned at lunch.\n\n“You can read it,” I said.\n\n“You think so?”\n\n“Read it.”\n\n“I cannot read it. It is dirty.”\n\nI wiped it off with the rag.\n\n“How’s that?”\n\n“Twenty-five lire.”\n\n“What?” I said. “You could have read it. It’s only dirty from the state\nof the roads.”\n\n“You don’t like Italian roads?”\n\n“They are dirty.”\n\n“Fifty lire.” He spat in the road. “Your car is dirty and you are dirty\ntoo.”\n\n“Good. And give me a receipt with your name.”\n\nHe took out a receipt-book, made in duplicate, and perforated, so one\nside could be given to the customer, and the other side filled in and\nkept as a stub. There was no carbon to record what the customer’s ticket\nsaid.\n\n“Give me fifty lire.”\n\nHe wrote in indelible pencil, tore out the slip and handed it to me. I\nread it.\n\n“This is for twenty-five lire.”\n\n“A mistake,” he said, and changed the twenty-five to fifty.\n\n“And now the other side. Make it fifty in the part you keep.”\n\nHe smiled a beautiful Italian smile and wrote something on the receipt\nstub, holding it so I could not see.\n\n“Go on,” he said, “before your number gets dirty again.”\n\nWe drove for two hours after it was dark and slept in Mentone that\nnight. It seemed very cheerful and clean and sane and lovely. We had\ndriven from Ventimiglia to Pisa and Florence, across the Romagna to\nRimini, back through Forli, Imola, Bologna, Parma, Piacenza and Genoa,\nto Ventimiglia again. The whole trip had only taken ten days. Naturally,\nin such a short trip, we had no opportunity to see how things were with\nthe country or the people.\n\n“HOW are you going yourself, Jack?” I asked him.\n\n“You seen this, Walcott?” he says.\n\n“Just in the gym.”"}
{"text": "“Well,” Jack says, “I’m going to need a lot of luck with that boy.”\n\n“He can’t hit you, Jack,” Soldier said.\n\n“I wish to hell he couldn’t.”\n\n“He couldn’t hit you with a handful of bird-shot.”\n\n“Bird-shot’d be all right,” Jack says. “I wouldn’t mind bird-shot any.”\n\n“He looks easy to hit,” I said.\n\n“Sure,” Jack says, “he ain’t going to last long. He ain’t going to last\nlike you and me, Jerry. But right now he’s got everything.”\n\n“You’ll left-hand him to death.”\n\n“Maybe,” Jack says. “Sure. I got a chance to.”\n\n“Handle him like you handled Kid Lewis.”\n\n“Kid Lewis,” Jack said. “That kike!”\n\nThe three of us, Jack Brennan, Soldier Bartlett, and I were in\nHandley’s. There were a couple of broads sitting at the next table to\nus. They had been drinking.\n\n“What do you mean, kike?” one of the broads says. “What do you mean,\nkike, you big Irish bum?”\n\n“Sure,” Jack says. “That’s it.”\n\n“Kikes,” this broad goes on. “They’re always talking about kikes, these\nbig Irishmen. What do you mean, kikes?”\n\n“Come on. Let’s get out of here.”\n\n“Kikes,” this broad goes on. “Whoever saw you ever buy a drink? Your\nwife sews your pockets up every morning. These Irishmen and their kikes!\nTed Lewis could lick you too.”\n\n“Sure,” Jack says. “And you give away a lot of things free too, don’t\nyou?”\n\nWe went out. That was Jack. He could say what he wanted to when he\nwanted to say it.\n\nJack started training out at Danny Hogan’s health-farm over in Jersey.\nIt was nice out there but Jack didn’t like it much. He didn’t like being\naway from his wife and the kids, and he was sore and grouchy most of the\ntime. He liked me and we got along fine together; and he liked Hogan,\nbut after a while Soldier Bartlett commenced to get on his nerves. A\nkidder gets to be an awful thing around a camp if his stuff goes sort of\nsour. Soldier was always kidding Jack, just sort of kidding him all the\ntime. It wasn’t very funny and it wasn’t very good, and it began to get\nto Jack. It was sort of stuff like this. Jack would finish up with the\nweights and the bag and pull on the gloves.\n\n“You want to work?” he’d say to Soldier.\n\n“Sure. How you want me to work?” Soldier would ask. “Want me to treat\nyou rough like Walcott? Want me to knock you down a few times?”\n\n“That’s it,” Jack would say. He didn’t like it any, though.\n\nOne morning we were all out on the road. We’d been out quite a way and\nnow we were coming back. We’d go along fast for three minutes and then\nwalk a minute, and then go fast for three minutes again. Jack wasn’t\never what you would call a sprinter. He’d move around fast enough in the\nring if he had to, but he wasn’t any too fast on the road. All the time\nwe were walking Soldier was kidding him. We came up the hill to the\nfarmhouse.\n\n“Well,” says Jack, “you better go back to town, Soldier.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“You better go back to town and stay there.”\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“I’m sick of hearing you talk.”\n\n“Yes?” says Soldier.\n\n“Yes,” says Jack.\n\n“You’ll be a damn sight sicker when Walcott gets through with you.”\n\n“Sure,” says Jack, “maybe I will. But I know I’m sick of you.”\n\nSo Soldier went off on the train to town that same morning. I went down\nwith him to the train. He was good and sore.\n\n“I was just kidding him,” he said. We were waiting on the platform. “He\ncan’t pull that stuff with me, Jerry.”\n\n“He’s nervous and crabby,” I said. “He’s a good fellow, Soldier.”\n\n“The hell he is. The hell he’s ever been a good fellow.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “so long, Soldier.”\n\nThe train had come in. He climbed up with his bag.\n\n“So long, Jerry,” he says. “You be in town before the fight?”\n\n“I don’t think so.”\n\n“See you then.”\n\nHe went in and the conductor swung up and the train went out. I rode\nback to the farm in the cart. Jack was on the porch writing a letter to\nhis wife. The mail had come and I got the papers and went over on the\nother side of the porch and sat down to read. Hogan came out the door\nand walked over to me.\n\n“Did he have a jam with Soldier?”\n\n“Not a jam,” I said. “He just told him to go back to town.”\n\n“I could see it coming,” Hogan said. “He never liked Soldier much.”\n\n“No. He don’t like many people.”\n\n“He’s a pretty cold one,” Hogan said.\n\n“Well, he’s always been fine to me.”"}
{"text": "“Me too,” Hogan said. “I got no kick on him. He’s a cold one, though.”\n\nHogan went in through the screen door and I sat there on the porch and\nread the papers. It was just starting to get fall weather and it’s nice\ncountry there in Jersey, up in the hills, and after I read the paper\nthrough I sat there and looked out at the country and the road down\nbelow against the woods with cars going along it, lifting the dust up.\nIt was fine weather and pretty nice-looking country. Hogan came to the\ndoor and I said, “Say, Hogan, haven’t you got anything to shoot out\nhere?”\n\n“No,” Hogan said. “Only sparrows.”\n\n“Seen the paper?” I said to Hogan.\n\n“What’s in it?”\n\n“Sande booted three of them in yesterday.”\n\n“I got that on the telephone last night.”\n\n“You follow them pretty close, Hogan?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, I keep in touch with them,” Hogan said.\n\n“How about Jack?” I says. “Does he still play them?”\n\n“Him?” said Hogan. “Can you see him doing it?”\n\nJust then Jack came around the corner with the letter in his hand. He’s\nwearing a sweater and an old pair of pants and boxing shoes.\n\n“Got a stamp, Hogan?” he asks.\n\n“Give me the letter,” Hogan said. “I’ll mail it for you.”\n\n“Say, Jack,” I said, “didn’t you used to play the ponies?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“I knew you did. I knew I used to see you out at Sheepshead.”\n\n“What did you lay off them for?” Hogan asked.\n\n“Lost money.”\n\nJack sat down on the porch by me. He leaned back against a post. He shut\nhis eyes in the sun.\n\n“Want a chair?” Hogan asked.\n\n“No,” said Jack. “This is fine.”\n\n“It’s a nice day,” I said. “It’s pretty nice out in the country.”\n\n“I’d a damn sight rather be in town with the wife.”\n\n“Well, you only got another week.”\n\n“Yes,” Jack says. “That’s so.”\n\nWe sat there on the porch. Hogan was inside at the office.\n\n“What do you think about the shape I’m in?” Jack asked me.\n\n“Well, you can’t tell,” I said. “You got a week to get around into\nform.”\n\n“Don’t stall me.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “you’re not right.”\n\n“I’m not sleeping,” Jack said.\n\n“You’ll be all right in a couple of days.”\n\n“No,” says Jack, “I got the insomnia.”\n\n“What’s on your mind?”\n\n“I miss the wife.”\n\n“Have her come out.”\n\n“No. I’m too old for that.”\n\n“We’ll take a long walk before you turn in and get you good and tired.”\n\n“Tired!” Jack says. “I’m tired all the time.”\n\nHe was that way all week. He wouldn’t sleep at night and he’d get up in\nthe morning feeling that way, you know, when you can’t shut your hands.\n\n“He’s stale as poorhouse cake,” Hogan said. “He’s nothing.”\n\n“I never seen Walcott,” I said.\n\n“He’ll kill him,” said Hogan. “He’ll tear him in two.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “everybody’s got to get it sometime.”\n\n“Not like this, though,” Hogan said. “They’ll think he never trained. It\ngives the farm a black eye.”\n\n“You hear what the reporters said about him?”\n\n“Didn’t I! They said he was awful. They said they oughtn’t to let him\nfight.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “they’re always wrong, ain’t they?”\n\n“Yes,” said Hogan. “But this time they’re right.”\n\n“What the hell do they know about whether a man’s right or not?”\n\n“Well,” said Hogan, “they’re not such fools.”\n\n“All they did was pick Willard at Toledo. This Lardner, he’s so wise\nnow, ask him about when he picked Willard at Toledo.”\n\n“Aw, he wasn’t out,” Hogan said. “He only writes the big fights.”\n\n“I don’t care who they are,” I said. “What the hell do they know? They\ncan write maybe, but what the hell do they know?”\n\n“You don’t think Jack’s in any shape, do you?” Hogan asked.\n\n“No. He’s through. All he needs is to have Corbett pick him to win for\nit to be all over.”\n\n“Well, Corbett’ll pick him,” Hogan says.\n\n“Sure. He’ll pick him.”\n\nThat night Jack didn’t sleep any either. The next morning was the last\nday before the fight. After breakfast we were out on the porch again.\n\n“What do you think about, Jack, when you can’t sleep?” I said.\n\n“Oh, I worry,” Jack says. “I worry about property I got up in the Bronx,\nI worry about property I got in Florida. I worry about the kids. I worry\nabout the wife. Sometimes I think about fights. I think about that kike\nTed Lewis and I get sore. I got some stocks and I worry about them. What\nthe hell don’t I think about?”\n\n“Well,” I said, “to-morrow night it’ll all be over.”\n\n“Sure,” said Jack. “That always helps a lot, don’t it? That just fixes\neverything all up, I suppose. Sure.”"}
{"text": "He was sore all day. We didn’t do any work. Jack just moved around a\nlittle to loosen up. He shadow-boxed a few rounds. He didn’t even look\ngood doing that. He skipped the rope a little while. He couldn’t sweat.\n\n“He’d be better not to do any work at all,” Hogan said. We were standing\nwatching him skip rope. “Don’t he ever sweat at all any more?”\n\n“He can’t sweat.”\n\n“Do you suppose he’s got the con? He never had any trouble making\nweight, did he?”\n\n“No, he hasn’t got any con. He just hasn’t got anything inside any\nmore.”\n\n“He ought to sweat,” said Hogan.\n\nJack came over, skipping the rope. He was skipping up and down in front\nof us, forward and back, crossing his arms every third time.\n\n“Well,” he says. “What are you buzzards talking about?”\n\n“I don’t think you ought to work any more,” Hogan says. “You’ll be\nstale.”\n\n“Wouldn’t that be awful?” Jack says and skips away down the floor,\nslapping the rope hard.\n\nThat afternoon John Collins showed up out at the farm. Jack was up in\nhis room. John, came out in a car from town. He had a couple of friends\nwith him. The car stopped and they all got out.\n\n“Where’s Jack?” John asked me.\n\n“Up in his room, lying down.”\n\n“Lying down?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\n“How is he?”\n\nI looked at the two fellows that were with John.\n\n“They’re friends of his,” John said.\n\n“He’s pretty bad,” I said.\n\n“What’s the matter with him?”\n\n“He don’t sleep.”\n\n“Hell,” said John. “That Irishman could never sleep.”\n\n“He isn’t right,” I said.\n\n“Hell,” John said. “He’s never right. I’ve had him for ten years and\nhe’s never been right yet.”\n\nThe fellows who were with him laughed.\n\n“I want you to shake hands with Mr. Morgan and Mr. Steinfelt,” John\nsaid. “This is Mr. Doyle. He’s been training Jack.”\n\n“Glad to meet you,” I said.\n\n“Let’s go up and see the boy,” the fellow called Morgan said.\n\n“Let’s have a look at him,” Steinfelt said.\n\nWe all went upstairs.\n\n“Where’s Hogan?” John asked.\n\n“He’s out in the barn with a couple of his customers,” I said.\n\n“He got many people out here now?” John asked.\n\n“Just two.”\n\n“Pretty quiet, ain’t it?” Morgan said.\n\n“Yes,” I said. “It’s pretty quiet.”\n\nWe were outside Jack’s room. John knocked on the door. There wasn’t any\nanswer.\n\n“Maybe he’s asleep,” I said.\n\n“What the hell’s he sleeping in the daytime for?”\n\nJohn turned the handle and we all went in. Jack was lying asleep on the\nbed. He was face down and his face was in the pillow. Both his arms were\naround the pillow.\n\n“Hey, Jack!” John said to him.\n\nJack’s head moved a little on the pillow. “Jack!” John says, leaning\nover him. Jack just dug a little deeper in the pillow. John touched him\non the shoulder. Jack sat up and looked at us. He hadn’t shaved and he\nwas wearing an old sweater.\n\n“Christ! Why can’t you let me sleep?” he says to John.\n\n“Don’t be sore,” John says. “I didn’t mean to wake you up.”\n\n“Oh no,” Jack says. “Of course not.”\n\n“You know Morgan and Steinfelt,” John said.\n\n“Glad to see you,” Jack says.\n\n“How do you feel, Jack,” Morgan asks him.\n\n“Fine,” Jack says. “How the hell would I feel?”\n\n“You look fine,” Steinfelt says.\n\n“Yes, don’t I,” says Jack. “Say,” he says to John. “You’re my manager.\nYou get a big enough cut. Why the hell don’t you come out here when the\nreporters was out! You want Jerry and me to talk to them?”\n\n“I had Lew fighting in Philadelphia,” John said.\n\n“What the hell’s that to me?” Jack says. “You’re my manager. You get a\nbig enough cut, don’t you? You aren’t making me any money in\nPhiladelphia, are you? Why the hell aren’t you out here when I ought to\nhave you?”\n\n“Hogan was here.”\n\n“Hogan,” Jack says. “Hogan’s as dumb as I am.”\n\n“Soldier Bathlett was out here wukking with you for a while, wasn’t he?”\nSteinfelt said to change the subject.\n\n“Yes, he was out here,” Jack says. “He was out here all right.”\n\n“Say, Jerry,” John said to me. “Would you go and find Hogan and tell him\nwe want to see him in about half an hour?”\n\n“Sure,” I said.\n\n“Why the hell can’t he stick around?” Jack says. “Stick around, Jerry.”\n\nMorgan and Steinfelt looked at each other.\n\n“Quiet down, Jack,” John said to him.\n\n“I better go find Hogan,” I said.\n\n“All right, if you want to go,” Jack says. “None of these guys are going\nto send you away, though.”\n\n“I’ll go find Hogan,” I said."}
{"text": "Hogan was out in the gym in the barn. He had a couple of his health-farm\npatients with the gloves on. They neither one wanted to hit the other,\nfor fear the other would come back and hit him.\n\n“That’ll do,” Hogan said when he saw me come in. “You can stop the\nslaughter. You gentlemen take a shower and Bruce will rub you down.”\n\nThey climbed out through the ropes and Hogan came over to me.\n\n“John Collins is out with a couple of friends to see Jack,” I said.\n\n“I saw them come up in the car.”\n\n“Who are the two fellows with John?”\n\n“They’re what you call wise boys,” Hogan said. “Don’t you know them\ntwo?”\n\n“No,” I said.\n\n“That’s Happy Steinfelt and Lew Morgan. They got a pool-room.”\n\n“I been away a long time,” I said.\n\n“Sure,” said Hogan. “That Happy Steinfelt’s a big operator.”\n\n“I’ve heard his name,” I said.\n\n“He’s a pretty smooth boy,” Hogan said. “They’re a couple of\nsharpshooters.”\n\n“Well,” I said. “They want to see us in half an hour.”\n\n“You mean they don’t want to see us until a half an hour?”\n\n“That’s it.”\n\n“Come on in the office,” Hogan said. “To hell with those sharpshooters.”\n\nAfter about thirty minutes or so Hogan and I went upstairs. We knocked\non Jack’s door. They were talking inside the room.\n\n“Wait a minute,” somebody said.\n\n“To hell with that stuff,” Hogan said. “When you want to see me I’m down\nin the office.”\n\nWe heard the door unlock. Steinfelt opened it.\n\n“Come on in, Hogan,” he says. “We’re all going to have a drink.”\n\n“Well,” says Hogan. “That’s something.”\n\nWe went in. Jack was sitting on the bed. John and Morgan were sitting on\na couple of chairs. Steinfelt was standing up.\n\n“You’re a pretty mysterious lot of boys,” Hogan said.\n\n“Hello, Danny,” John says.\n\n“Hello, Danny,” Morgan says and shakes hands.\n\nJack doesn’t say anything. He just sits there on the bed. He ain’t with\nthe others. He’s all by himself. He was wearing an old blue jersey and\npants and had on boxing shoes. He needed a shave. Steinfelt and Morgan\nwere dressers. John was quite a dresser too. Jack sat there looking\nIrish and tough.\n\nSteinfelt brought out a bottle and Hogan brought in some glasses and\neverybody had a drink. Jack and I took one and the rest of them went on\nand had two or three each.\n\n“Better save some for your ride back,” Hogan said.\n\n“Don’t you worry. We got plenty,” Morgan said.\n\nJack hadn’t drunk anything since the one drink. He was standing up and\nlooking at them. Morgan was sitting on the bed where Jack had sat.\n\n“Have a drink, Jack,” John said and handed him the glass and the bottle.\n\n“No,” Jack said, “I never liked to go to these wakes.”\n\nThey all laughed. Jack didn’t laugh.\n\nThey were all feeling pretty good when they left. Jack stood on the\nporch when they got into the car. They waved to him.\n\n“So long,” Jack said.\n\nWe had supper. Jack didn’t say anything all during the meal except,\n“Will you pass me this?” or “Will you pass me that?” The two health-farm\npatients ate at the same table with us. They were pretty nice fellows.\nAfter we finished eating we went out on the porch. It was dark early.\n\n“Like to take a walk, Jerry?” Jack asked.\n\n“Sure,” I said.\n\nWe put on our coats and started out. It was quite a way down to the main\nroad and then we walked along the main road about a mile and a half.\nCars kept going by and we would pull out to the side until they were\npast. Jack didn’t say anything. After we had stepped out into the bushes\nto let a big car go by Jack said, “To hell with this walking. Come on\nback to Hogan’s.”\n\nWe went along a side road that cut up over the hill and cut across the\nfields back to Hogan’s. We could see the lights of the house up on the\nhill. We came around to the front of the house and there standing in the\ndoorway was Hogan.\n\n“Have a good walk?” Hogan asked.\n\n“Oh, fine,” Jack said. “Listen, Hogan. Have you got any liquor?”\n\n“Sure,” says Hogan. “What’s the idea?”\n\n“Send it up to the room,” Jack says. “I’m going to sleep to-night.”\n\n“You’re the doctor,” Hogan says.\n\n“Come on up to the room, Jerry,” Jack says.\n\nUpstairs Jack sat on the bed with his head in his hands.\n\n“Ain’t it a life?” Jack says.\n\nHogan brought in a quart of liquor and two glasses.\n\n“Want some ginger-ale?”\n\n“What do you think I want to do, get sick?”\n\n“I just asked you,” said Hogan.\n\n“Have a drink?” said Jack."}
{"text": "“No, thanks,” said Hogan. He went out.\n\n“How about you, Jerry?”\n\n“I’ll have one with you,” I said.\n\nJack poured out a couple of drinks. “Now,” he said, “I want to take it\nslow and easy.”\n\n“Put some water in it,” I said.\n\n“Yes,” Jack said. “I guess that’s better.”\n\nWe had a couple of drinks without saying anything. Jack started to pour\nme another.\n\n“No,” I said, “that’s all I want.”\n\n“All right,” Jack said. He poured himself out another big shot and put\nwater in it. He was lighting up a little.\n\n“That was a fine bunch out here this afternoon,” he said. “They don’t\ntake any chances, those two.”\n\nThen a little later, “Well,” he says, “they’re right. What the hell’s\nthe good in taking chances?”\n\n“Don’t you want another, Jerry?” he said. “Come on, drink along with\nme.”\n\n“I don’t need it, Jack,” I said. “I feel all right.”\n\n“Just have one more,” Jack said. It was softening him up.\n\n“All right,” I said.\n\nJack poured one for me and another big one for himself.\n\n“You know,” he said, “I like liquor pretty well. If I hadn’t been boxing\nI would have drunk quite a lot.”\n\n“Sure,” I said.\n\n“You know,” he said, “I missed a lot, boxing.”\n\n“You made plenty of money.”\n\n“Sure, that’s what I’m after. You know I miss a lot, Jerry.”\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\n“Well,” he says, “like about the wife. And being away from home so much.\nIt don’t do my girls any good. ‘Whose your old man?’ some of those\nsociety kids’ll say to them. ‘My old man’s Jack Brennan.’ That don’t do\nthem any good.”\n\n“Hell,” I said, “all that makes a difference is if they got dough.”\n\n“Well,” says Jack, “I got the dough for them all right.”\n\nHe poured out another drink. The bottle was about empty.\n\n“Put some water in it,” I said. Jack poured in some water.\n\n“You know,” he says, “you ain’t got any idea how I miss the wife.”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“You ain’t got any idea. You can’t have an idea what it’s like.”\n\n“It ought to be better out in the country than in town.”\n\n“With me now,” Jack said, “it don’t make any difference where I am. You\ncan’t have an idea what it’s like.”\n\n“Have another drink.”\n\n“Am I getting soused? Do I talk funny?”\n\n“You’re coming on all right.”\n\n“You can’t have an idea what it’s like. They ain’t anybody can have an\nidea what it’s like.”\n\n“Except the wife,” I said.\n\n“She knows,” Jack said. “She knows all right. She knows. You bet she\nknows.”\n\n“Put some water in that,” I said.\n\n“Jerry,” says Jack, “you can’t have an idea what it gets to be like.”\n\nHe was good and drunk. He was looking at me steady. His eyes were sort\nof too steady.\n\n“You’ll sleep all right,” I said.\n\n“Listen, Jerry,” Jack says. “You want to make some money? Get some money\ndown on Walcott.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Listen, Jerry,” Jack put down the glass. “I’m not drunk now, see? You\nknow what I’m betting on him? Fifty grand.”\n\n“That’s a lot of dough.”\n\n“Fifty grand,” Jack says, “at two to one. I’ll get twenty-five thousand\nbucks. Get some money on him, Jerry.”\n\n“It sounds good,” I said.\n\n“How can I beat him?” Jack says. “It ain’t crooked. How can I beat him?\nWhy not make money on it?”\n\n“Put some water in that,” I said.\n\n“I’m through after this fight,” Jack says. “I’m through with it. I got\nto take a beating. Why shouldn’t I make money on it?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“I ain’t slept for a week,” Jack says. “All night I lay awake and worry\nmy can off. I can’t sleep, Jerry. You ain’t got an idea what it’s like\nwhen you can’t sleep.”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“I can’t sleep. That’s all. I just can’t sleep. What’s the use of taking\ncare of yourself all these years when you can’t sleep?”\n\n“It’s bad.”\n\n“You ain’t got an idea what it’s like, Jerry, when you can’t sleep.”\n\n“Put some water in that,” I said.\n\nWell, about eleven o’clock Jack passes out and I put him to bed. Finally\nhe’s so he can’t keep from sleeping. I helped him get his clothes off\nand got him into bed.\n\n“You’ll sleep all right, Jack,” I said.\n\n“Sure,” Jack says, “I’ll sleep now.”\n\n“Good-night, Jack,” I said.\n\n“Good-night, Jerry,” Jack says. “You’re the only friend I got.”\n\n“Oh, hell,” I said.\n\n“You’re the only friend I got,” Jack says, “the only friend I got.”\n\n“Go to sleep,” I said.\n\n“I’ll sleep,” Jack says.\n\nDownstairs Hogan was sitting at the desk in the office reading the\npapers. He looked up. “Well, you get your boy friend to sleep?” he asks.\n\n“He’s off.”\n\n“It’s better for him than not sleeping,” Hogan said.\n\n“Sure.”"}
{"text": "“You’d have a hell of a time explaining that to these sport writers\nthough,” Hogan said.\n\n“Well, I’m going to bed myself,” I said.\n\n“Good-night,” said Hogan.\n\nIn the morning I came downstairs about eight o’clock and got some\nbreakfast. Hogan had his two customers out in the barn doing exercises.\nI went out and watched them.\n\n“One! Two! Three! Four!” Hogan was counting for them. “Hello, Jerry,” he\nsaid. “Is Jack up yet?”\n\n“No. He’s still sleeping.”\n\nI went back to my room and packed up to go in to town. About nine-thirty\nI heard Jack getting up in the next room. When I heard him go downstairs\nI went down after him. Jack was sitting at the breakfast table. Hogan\nhad come in and was standing beside the table.\n\n“How do you feel, Jack?” I asked him.\n\n“Not so bad.”\n\n“Sleep well?” Hogan asked.\n\n“I slept all right,” Jack said. “I got a thick tongue but I ain’t got a\nhead.”\n\n“Good,” said Hogan. “That was good liquor.”\n\n“Put it on the bill,” Jack says.\n\n“What time you want to go into town?” Hogan asked.\n\n“Before lunch,” Jack says. “The eleven o’clock train.”\n\n“Sit down, Jerry,” Jack said. Hogan went out.\n\nI sat down at the table. Jack was eating a grape-fruit. When he’d find a\nseed he’d spit it out in the spoon and dump it on the plate.\n\n“I guess I was pretty stewed last night,” he started.\n\n“You drank some liquor.”\n\n“I guess I said a lot of fool things.”\n\n“You weren’t bad.”\n\n“Where’s Hogan?” he asked. He was through with the grape-fruit.\n\n“He’s out in front in the office.”\n\n“What did I say about betting on the fight?” Jack asked. He was holding\nthe spoon and sort of poking at the grape-fruit with it.\n\nThe girl came in with some ham and eggs and took away the grape-fruit.\n\n“Bring me another glass of milk,” Jack said to her. She went out.\n\n“You said you had fifty grand on Walcott,” I said.\n\n“That’s right,” Jack said.\n\n“That’s a lot of money.”\n\n“I don’t feel too good about it,” Jack said.\n\n“Something might happen.”\n\n“No,” Jack said. “He wants the title bad. They’ll be shooting with him\nall right.”\n\n“You can’t ever tell.”\n\n“No. He wants the title. It’s worth a lot of money to him.”\n\n“Fifty grand is a lot of money,” I said.\n\n“It’s business,” said Jack. “I can’t win. You know I can’t win anyway.”\n\n“As long as you’re in there you got a chance.”\n\n“No,” Jack says. “I’m all through. It’s just business.”\n\n“How do you feel?”\n\n“Pretty good,” Jack said. “The sleep was what I needed.”\n\n“You might go good.”\n\n“I’ll give them a good show,” Jack said.\n\nAfter breakfast Jack called up his wife on the long-distance. He was\ninside the booth telephoning.\n\n“That’s the first time he’s called her up since he’s out here,” Hogan\nsaid.\n\n“He writes her every day.”\n\n“Sure,” Hogan says, “a letter only costs two cents.”\n\nHogan said good-by to us and Bruce, the nigger rubber, drove us down to\nthe train in the cart.\n\n“Good-by, Mr. Brennan,” Bruce said at the train, “I sure hope you knock\nhis can off.”\n\n“So long,” Jack said. He gave Bruce two dollars. Bruce had worked on him\na lot. He looked kind of disappointed. Jack saw me looking at Bruce\nholding the two dollars.\n\n“It’s all in the bill,” he said. “Hogan charged me for the rubbing.”\n\nOn the train going into town Jack didn’t talk. He sat in the corner of\nthe seat with his ticket in his hat-band and looked out of the window.\nOnce he turned and spoke to me.\n\n“I told the wife I’d take a room at the Shelby to-night,” he said. “It’s\njust around the corner from the Garden. I can go up to the house\nto-morrow morning.”\n\n“That’s a good idea,” I said. “Your wife ever see you fight, Jack?”\n\n“No,” Jack says. “She never seen me fight.”\n\nI thought he must be figuring on taking an awful beating if he doesn’t\nwant to go home afterward. In town we took a taxi up to the Shelby. A\nboy came out and took our bags and we went in to the desk.\n\n“How much are the rooms?” Jack asked.\n\n“We only have double rooms,” the clerk says. “I can give you a nice\ndouble room for ten dollars.”\n\n“That’s too steep.”\n\n“I can give you a double room for seven dollars.”\n\n“With a bath?”\n\n“Certainly.”\n\n“You might as well bunk with me, Jerry,” Jack says.\n\n“Oh,” I said, “I’ll sleep down at my brother-in-law’s.”\n\n“I don’t mean for you to pay it,” Jack says. “I just want to get my\nmoney’s worth.”"}
{"text": "“Will you register, please?” the clerk says. He looked at the names.\n“Number 238, Mister Brennan.”\n\nWe went up in the elevator. It was a nice big room with two beds and a\ndoor opening into a bath-room.\n\n“This is pretty good,” Jack says.\n\nThe boy who brought us up pulled up the curtains and brought in our\nbags. Jack didn’t make any move, so I gave the boy a quarter. We washed\nup and Jack said we better go out and get something to eat.\n\nWe ate a lunch at Jimmey Handley’s place. Quite a lot of the boys were\nthere. When we were about half through eating, John came in and sat down\nwith us. Jack didn’t talk much.\n\n“How are you on the weight, Jack?” John asked him. Jack was putting away\na pretty good lunch.\n\n“I could make it with my clothes on,” Jack said. He never had to worry\nabout taking off weight. He was a natural welter-weight and he’d never\ngotten fat. He’d lost weight out at Hogan’s.\n\n“Well, that’s one thing you never had to worry about,” John said.\n\n“That’s one thing,” Jack says.\n\nWe went around to the garden to weigh in after lunch. The match was made\nat a hundred forty-seven pounds at three o’clock. Jack stepped on the\nscales with a towel around him. The bar didn’t move. Walcott had just\nweighed and was standing with a lot of people around him.\n\n“Let’s see what you weigh, Jack,” Freedman, Walcott’s manager said.\n\n“All right, weigh _him_ then,” Jack jerked his head toward Walcott.\n\n“Drop the towel,” Freedman said.\n\n“What do you make it?” Jack asked the fellows who were weighing.\n\n“One hundred and forty-three pounds,” the fat man who was weighing said.\n\n“You’re down fine, Jack,” Freedman says.\n\n“Weigh _him_,” Jack says.\n\nWalcott came over. He was a blond with wide shoulders and arms like a\nheavyweight. He didn’t have much legs. Jack stood about half a head\ntaller than he did.\n\n“Hello, Jack,” he said. His face was plenty marked up.\n\n“Hello,” said Jack. “How you feel?”\n\n“Good,” Walcott says. He dropped the towel from around his waist and\nstood on the scales. He had the widest shoulders and back you ever saw.\n\n“One hundred and forty-six pounds and twelve ounces.”\n\nWalcott stepped off and grinned at Jack.\n\n“Well,” John says to him, “Jack’s spotting you about four pounds.”\n\n“More than that when I come in, kid,” Walcott says. “I’m going to go and\neat now.”\n\nWe went back and Jack got dressed. “He’s a pretty tough-looking boy,”\nJack says to me.\n\n“He looks as though he’d been hit plenty of times.”\n\n“Oh, yes,” Jack says. “He ain’t hard to hit.”\n\n“Where are you going?” John asked when Jack was dressed.\n\n“Back to the hotel,” Jack says. “You looked after everything?”\n\n“Yes,” John says. “It’s all looked after.”\n\n“I’m going to lie down a while,” Jack says.\n\n“I’ll come around for you about a quarter to seven and we’ll go and\neat.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nUp at the hotel Jack took off his shoes and his coat and lay down for a\nwhile. I wrote a letter. I looked over a couple of times and Jack wasn’t\nsleeping. He was lying perfectly still but every once in a while his\neyes would open. Finally he sits up.\n\n“Want to play some cribbage, Jerry?” he says.\n\n“Sure,” I said.\n\nHe went over to his suitcase and got out the cards and the cribbage\nboard. We played cribbage and he won three dollars off me. John knocked\nat the door and came in.\n\n“Want to play some cribbage, John?” Jack asked him.\n\nJohn put his kelly down on the table. It was all wet. His coat was wet\ntoo.\n\n“Is it raining?” Jack asks.\n\n“It’s pouring,” John says. “The taxi I had, got tied up in the traffic\nand I got out and walked.”\n\n“Come on, play some cribbage,” Jack says.\n\n“You ought to go and eat.”\n\n“No,” says Jack. “I don’t want to eat yet.”\n\nSo they played cribbage for about half an hour and Jack won a dollar and\na half off him.\n\n“Well, I suppose we got to go eat,” Jack says. He went to the window and\nlooked out.\n\n“Is it still raining?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Let’s eat in the hotel,” John says.\n\n“All right,” Jack says, “I’ll play you once more to see who pays for the\nmeal.”\n\nAfter a little while Jack gets up and says, “You buy the meal, John,”\nand we went downstairs and ate in the big dining-room."}
{"text": "After we ate we went upstairs and Jack played cribbage with John again\nand won two dollars and a half off him. Jack was feeling pretty good.\nJohn had a bag with him with all his stuff in it. Jack took off his\nshirt and collar and put on a jersey and a sweater, so he wouldn’t catch\ncold when he came out, and put his ring clothes and his bathrobe in a\nbag.\n\n“You all ready?” John asks him. “I’ll call up and have them get a taxi.”\n\nPretty soon the telephone rang and they said the taxi was waiting.\n\nWe rode down in the elevator and went out through the lobby, and got in\na taxi and rode around to the Garden. It was raining hard but there was\na lot of people outside on the streets. The Garden was sold out. As we\ncame in on our way to the dressing-room I saw how full it was. It looked\nlike half a mile down to the ring. It was all dark. Just the lights over\nthe ring.\n\n“It’s a good thing, with this rain, they didn’t try and pull this fight\nin the ball park,” John said.\n\n“They got a good crowd,” Jack says.\n\n“This is a fight that would draw a lot more than the Garden could hold.”\n\n“You can’t tell about the weather,” Jack says.\n\nJohn came to the door of the dressing-room and poked his head in. Jack\nwas sitting there with his bathrobe on, he had his arms folded and was\nlooking at the floor. John had a couple of handlers with him. They\nlooked over his shoulder. Jack looked up.\n\n“Is he in?” he asked.\n\n“He’s just gone down,” John said.\n\nWe started down. Walcott was just getting into the ring. The crowd gave\nhim a big hand. He climbed through between the ropes and put his two\nfists together and smiled, and shook them at the crowd, first at one\nside of the ring, then at the other, and then sat down. Jack got a good\nhand coming down through the crowd. Jack is Irish and the Irish always\nget a pretty good hand. An Irishman don’t draw in New York like a Jew or\nan Italian but they always get a good hand. Jack climbed up and bent\ndown to go through the ropes and Walcott came over from his corner and\npushed the rope down for Jack to go through. The crowd thought that was\nwonderful. Walcott put his hand on Jack’s shoulder and they stood there\njust for a second.\n\n“So you’re going to be one of these popular champions,” Jack says to\nhim. “Take your goddam hand off my shoulder.”\n\n“Be yourself,” Walcott says.\n\nThis is all great for the crowd. How gentlemanly the boys are before the\nfight! How they wish each other luck!\n\nSolly Freedman came over to our corner while Jack is bandaging his hands\nand John is over in Walcott’s corner. Jack puts his thumb through the\nslit in the bandage and then wrapped his hand nice and smooth. I taped\nit around the wrist and twice across the knuckles.\n\n“Hey,” Freedman says. “Where do you get all that tape?”\n\n“Feel of it,” Jack says. “It’s soft, ain’t it? Don’t be a hick.”\n\nFreedman stands there all the time while Jack bandages the other hand,\nand one of the boys that’s going to handle him brings the gloves and I\npull them on and work them around.\n\n“Say, Freedman,” Jack asks, “what nationality is this Walcott?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Solly says. “He’s some sort of a Dane.”\n\n“He’s a Bohemian,” the lad who brought the gloves said.\n\nThe referee called them out to the centre of the ring and Jack walks\nout. Walcott comes out smiling. They met and the referee put his arm on\neach of their shoulders.\n\n“Hello, popularity,” Jack says to Walcott.\n\n“Be yourself.”\n\n“What do you call yourself ‘Walcott’ for?” Jack says. “Didn’t you know\nhe was a nigger?”\n\n“Listen—” says the referee, and he gives them the same old line. Once\nWalcott interrupts him. He grabs Jack’s arm and says, “Can I hit when\nhe’s got me like this?”\n\n“Keep your hands off me,” Jack says. “There ain’t no moving-pictures of\nthis.”"}
{"text": "They went back to their corners. I lifted the bathrobe off Jack and he\nleaned on the ropes and flexed his knees a couple of times and scuffed\nhis shoes in the rosin. The gong rang and Jack turned quick and went\nout. Walcott came toward him and they touched gloves and as soon as\nWalcott dropped his hands Jack jumped his left into his face twice.\nThere wasn’t anybody ever boxed better than Jack. Walcott was after him,\ngoing forward all the time with his chin on his chest. He’s a hooker and\nhe carries his hands pretty low. All he knows is to get in there and\nsock. But every time he gets in there close, Jack has the left hand in\nhis face. It’s just as though it’s automatic. Jack just raises the left\nhand up and it’s in Walcott’s face. Three or four times Jack brings the\nright over but Walcott gets it on the shoulder or high up on the head.\nHe’s just like all these hookers. The only thing he’s afraid of is\nanother one of the same kind. He’s covered everywhere you can hurt him.\nHe don’t care about a left-hand in his face.\n\nAfter about four rounds Jack has him bleeding bad and his face all cut\nup, but every time Walcott’s got in close he’s socked so hard he’s got\ntwo big red patches on both sides just below Jack’s ribs. Every time he\ngets in close, Jack ties him up, then gets one hand loose and uppercuts\nhim, but when Walcott gets his hands loose he socks Jack in the body so\nthey can hear it outside in the street. He’s a socker.\n\nIt goes along like that for three rounds more. They don’t talk any.\nThey’re working all the time. We worked over Jack plenty too, in between\nthe rounds. He don’t look good at all but he never does much work in the\nring. He don’t move around much and that left-hand is just automatic.\nIt’s just like it was connected with Walcott’s face and Jack just had to\nwish it in every time. Jack is always calm in close and he doesn’t waste\nany juice. He knows everything about working in close too and he’s\ngetting away with a lot of stuff. While they were in our corner I\nwatched him tie Walcott up, get his right hand loose, turn it and come\nup with an uppercut that got Walcott’s nose with the heel of the glove.\nWalcott was bleeding bad and leaned his nose on Jack’s shoulder so as to\ngive Jack some of it too, and Jack sort of lifted his shoulder sharp and\ncaught him against the nose, and then brought down the right hand and\ndid the same thing again.\n\nWalcott was sore as hell. By the time they’d gone five rounds he hated\nJack’s guts. Jack wasn’t sore; that is, he wasn’t any sorer than he\nalways was. He certainly did used to make the fellows he fought hate\nboxing. That was why he hated Kid Lewis so. He never got the Kid’s goat.\nKid Lewis always had about three new dirty things Jack couldn’t do. Jack\nwas as safe as a church all the time he was in there, as long as he was\nstrong. He certainly was treating Walcott rough. The funny thing was it\nlooked as though Jack was an open classic boxer. That was because he had\nall that stuff too.\n\nAfter the seventh round Jack says, “My left’s getting heavy.”\n\nFrom then he started to take a beating. It didn’t show at first. But\ninstead of him running the fight it was Walcott was running it, instead\nof being safe all the time now he was in trouble. He couldn’t keep him\nout with the left hand now. It looked as though it was the same as ever,\nonly now instead of Walcott’s punches just missing him they were just\nhitting him. He took an awful beating in the body.\n\n“What’s the round?” Jack asked.\n\n“The eleventh.”\n\n“I can’t stay,” Jack says. “My legs are going bad.”\n\nWalcott had been just hitting him for a long time. It was like a\nbaseball catcher pulls the ball and takes some of the shock off. From\nnow on Walcott commenced to land solid. He certainly was a\nsocking-machine. Jack was just trying to block everything now. It didn’t\nshow what an awful beating he was taking. In between the rounds I worked\non his legs. The muscles would flutter under my hands all the time I was\nrubbing them. He was sick as hell.\n\n“How’s it go?” he asked John, turning around, his face all swollen.\n\n“It’s his fight.”"}
{"text": "“I think I can last,” Jack says. “I don’t want this bohunk to stop me.”\n\nIt was going just the way he thought it would. He knew he couldn’t beat\nWalcott. He wasn’t strong any more. He was all right though. His money\nwas all right and now he wanted to finish it off right to please\nhimself. He didn’t want to be knocked out.\n\nThe gong rang and we pushed him out. He went out slow. Walcott came\nright out after him. Jack put the left in his face and Walcott took it,\ncame in under it and started working on Jack’s body. Jack tried to tie\nhim up and it was just like trying to hold on to a buzz-saw. Jack broke\naway from it and missed with the right. Walcott clipped him with a\nleft-hook and Jack went down. He went down on his hands and knees and\nlooked at us. The referee started counting. Jack was watching us and\nshaking his head. At eight John motioned to him. You couldn’t hear on\naccount of the crowd. Jack got up. The referee had been holding Walcott\nback with one arm while he counted.\n\nWhen Jack was on his feet Walcott started toward him.\n\n“Watch yourself, Jimmy,” I heard Solly Freedman yell to him.\n\nWalcott came up to Jack looking at him. Jack stuck the left hand at him.\nWalcott just shook his head. He backed Jack up against the ropes,\nmeasured him and then hooked the left very light to the side of Jack’s\nhead and socked the right into the body as hard as he could sock, just\nas low as he could get it. He must have hit him five inches below the\nbelt. I thought the eyes would come out of Jack’s head. They stuck way\nout. His mouth come open.\n\nThe referee grabbed Walcott. Jack stepped forward. If he went down there\nwent fifty thousand bucks. He walked as though all his insides were\ngoing to fall out.\n\n“It wasn’t low,” he said. “It was a accident.”\n\nThe crowd were yelling so you couldn’t hear anything.\n\n“I’m all right,” Jack says. They were right in front of us. The referee\nlooks at John and then he shakes his head.\n\n“Come on, you polak son-of-a-bitch,” Jack says to Walcott.\n\nJohn was hanging onto the ropes. He had the towel ready to chuck in.\nJack was standing just a little way out from the ropes. He took a step\nforward. I saw the sweat come out on his face like somebody had squeezed\nit and a big drop went down his nose.\n\n“Come on and fight,” Jack says to Walcott.\n\nThe referee looked at John and waved Walcott on.\n\n“Go in there, you slob,” he says.\n\nWalcott went in. He didn’t know what to do either. He never thought Jack\ncould have stood it. Jack put the left in his face. There was such a\nhell of a lot of yelling going on. They were right in front of us.\nWalcott hit him twice. Jack’s face was the worst thing I ever saw,—the\nlook on it! He was holding himself and all his body together and it all\nshowed on his face. All the time he was thinking and holding his body in\nwhere it was busted.\n\nThen he started to sock. His face looked awful all the time. He started\nto sock with his hands low down by his side, swinging at Walcott.\nWalcott covered up and Jack was swinging wild at Walcott’s head. Then he\nswung the left and it hit Walcott in the groin and the right hit Walcott\nright bang where he’d hit Jack. Way low below the belt. Walcott went\ndown and grabbed himself there and rolled and twisted around.\n\nThe referee grabbed Jack and pushed him toward his corner. John jumps\ninto the ring. There was all this yelling going on. The referee was\ntalking with the judges and then the announcer got into the ring with\nthe megaphone and says, “Walcott on a foul.”\n\nThe referee is talking to John and he says, “What could I do? Jack\nwouldn’t take the foul. Then when he’s groggy he fouls him.”\n\n“He’d lost it anyway,” John says.\n\nJack’s sitting on the chair. I’ve got his gloves off and he’s holding\nhimself in down there with both hands. When he’s got something\nsupporting it his face doesn’t look so bad.\n\n“Go over and say you’re sorry,” John says into his ear. “It’ll look\ngood.”"}
{"text": "Jack stands up and the sweat comes out all over his face. I put the\nbathrobe around him and he holds himself in with one hand under the\nbathrobe and goes across the ring. They’ve picked Walcott up and they’re\nworking on him. There’re a lot of people in Walcott’s corner. Nobody\nspeaks to Jack. He leans over Walcott.\n\n“I’m sorry,” Jack says. “I didn’t mean to foul you.”\n\nWalcott doesn’t say anything. He looks too damned sick.\n\n“Well, you’re the champion now,” Jack says to him. “I hope you get a\nhell of a lot of fun out of it.”\n\n“Leave the kid alone,” Solly Freedman says.\n\n“Hello, Solly,” Jack says. “I’m sorry I fouled your boy.”\n\nFreedman just looks at him.\n\nJack went to his corner walking that funny jerky way and we got him down\nthrough the ropes and through the reporters’ tables and out down the\naisle. A lot of people want to slap Jack on the back. He goes out\nthrough all that mob in his bathrobe to the dressing-room. It’s a\npopular win for Walcott. That’s the way the money was bet in the Garden.\n\nOnce we got inside the dressing-room Jack lay down and shut his eyes.\n\n“We want to get to the hotel and get a doctor,” John says.\n\n“I’m all busted inside,” Jack says.\n\n“I’m sorry as hell, Jack,” John says.\n\n“It’s all right,” Jack says.\n\nHe lies there with his eyes shut.\n\n“They certainly tried a nice double-cross,” John said.\n\n“Your friends Morgan and Steinfelt,” Jack said. “You got nice friends.”\n\nHe lies there, his eyes are open now. His face has still got that awful\ndrawn look.\n\n“It’s funny how fast you can think when it means that much money,” Jack\nsays.\n\n“You’re some boy, Jack,” John says.\n\n“No,” Jack says. “It was nothing.”\n\nOUTSIDE, the snow was higher than the window. The sunlight came in\nthrough the window and shone on a map on the pine-board wall of the hut.\nThe sun was high and the light came in over the top of the snow. A\ntrench had been cut along the open side of the hut, and each clear day\nthe sun, shining on the wall, reflected heat against the snow and\nwidened the trench. It was late March. The major sat at a table against\nthe wall. His adjutant sat at another table.\n\nAround the major’s eyes were two white circles where his snow-glasses\nhad protected his face from the sun on the snow. The rest of his face\nhad been burned and then tanned and then burned through the tan. His\nnose was swollen and there were edges of loose skin where blisters had\nbeen. While he worked at the papers he put the fingers of his left hand\ninto a saucer of oil and then spread the oil over his face, touching it\nvery gently with the tips of his fingers. He was very careful to drain\nhis fingers on the edge of the saucer so there was only a film of oil on\nthem, and after he had stroked his forehead and his cheeks, he stroked\nhis nose very delicately between his fingers. When he had finished he\nstood up, took the saucer of oil and went into the small room of the hut\nwhere he slept. “I’m going to take a little sleep,” he said to the\nadjutant. In that army an adjutant is not a commissioned officer. “You\nwill finish up.”\n\n“Yes, signor maggiore,” the adjutant answered. He leaned back in his\nchair and yawned. He took a paper-covered book out of the pocket of his\ncoat and opened it; then laid it down on the table and lit his pipe. He\nleaned forward on the table to read and puffed at his pipe. Then he\nclosed the book and put it back in his pocket. He had too much\npaper-work to get through. He could not enjoy reading until it was done.\nOutside, the sun went behind a mountain and there was no more light on\nthe wall of the hut. A soldier came in and put some pine branches,\nchopped into irregular lengths, into the stove. “Be soft, Pinin,” the\nadjutant said to him. “The major is sleeping.”\n\nPinin was the major’s orderly. He was a dark-faced boy, and he fixed the\nstove, putting the pine wood in carefully, shut the door, and went into\nthe back of the hut again. The adjutant went on with his papers.\n\n“Tonani,” the major called.\n\n“Signor maggiore?”\n\n“Send Pinin in to me.”\n\n“Pinin!” the adjutant called. Pinin came into the room. “The major wants\nyou,” the adjutant said."}
{"text": "Pinin walked across the main room of the hut toward the major’s door. He\nknocked on the half-opened door. “Signor maggiore?”\n\n“Come in,” the adjutant heard the major say, “and shut the door.”\n\nInside the room the major lay on his bunk. Pinin stood beside the bunk.\nThe major lay with his head on the rucksack that he had stuffed with\nspare clothing to make a pillow. His long, burned, oiled face looked at\nPinin. His hands lay on the blankets.\n\n“You are nineteen?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, signor maggiore.”\n\n“You have ever been in love?”\n\n“How do you mean, signor maggiore?”\n\n“In love—with a girl?”\n\n“I have been with girls.”\n\n“I did not ask that. I asked if you had been in love—with a girl.”\n\n“Yes, signor maggiore.”\n\n“You are in love with this girl now? You don’t write her. I read all\nyour letters.”\n\n“I am in love with her,” Pinin said, “but I do not write her.”\n\n“You are sure of this?”\n\n“I am sure.”\n\n“Tonani,” the major said in the same tone of voice, “can you hear me\ntalking?”\n\nThere was no answer from the next room.\n\n“He can not hear,” the major said. “And you are quite sure that you love\na girl?”\n\n“I am sure.”\n\n“And,” the major looked at him quickly, “that you are not corrupt?”\n\n“I don’t know what you mean, corrupt.”\n\n“All right,” the major said. “You needn’t be superior.”\n\nPinin looked at the floor. The major looked at his brown face, down and\nup him, and at his hands. Then he went on, not smiling, “And you don’t\nreally want—” the major paused. Pinin looked at the floor. “That your\ngreat desire isn’t really—” Pinin looked at the floor. The major leaned\nhis head back on the rucksack and smiled. He was really relieved: life\nin the army was too complicated. “You’re a good boy,” he said. “You’re a\ngood boy, Pinin. But don’t be superior and be careful some one else\ndoesn’t come along and take you.”\n\nPinin stood still beside the bunk.\n\n“Don’t be afraid,” the major said. His hands were folded on the\nblankets. “I won’t touch you. You can go back to your platoon if you\nlike. But you had better stay on as my servant. You’ve less chance of\nbeing killed.”\n\n“Do you want anything of me, signor maggiore?”\n\n“No,” the major said. “Go on and get on with whatever you were doing.\nLeave the door open when you go out.”\n\nPinin went out, leaving the door open. The adjutant looked up at him as\nhe walked awkwardly across the room and out the door. Pinin was flushed\nand moved differently than he had moved when he brought in the wood for\nthe fire. The adjutant looked after him and smiled. Pinin came in with\nmore wood for the stove. The major, lying on his bunk, looking at his\ncloth-covered helmet and his snow-glasses that hung from a nail on the\nwall, heard him walk across the floor. The little devil, he thought, I\nwonder if he lied to me.\n\nAFTER one Fourth of July, Nick, driving home late from town in the big\nwagon with Joe Garner and his family, passed nine drunken Indians along\nthe road. He remembered there were nine because Joe Garner, driving\nalong in the dusk, pulled up the horses, jumped down into the road and\ndragged an Indian out of the wheel rut. The Indian had been asleep, face\ndown in the sand. Joe dragged him into the bushes and got back up on the\nwagon-box.\n\n“That makes nine of them,” Joe said, “just between here and the edge of\ntown.”\n\n“Them Indians,” said Mrs. Garner.\n\nNick was on the back seat with the two Garner boys. He was looking out\nfrom the back seat to see the Indian where Joe had dragged him alongside\nof the road.\n\n“Was it Billy Tabeshaw?” Carl asked.\n\n“No.”\n\n“His pants looked mighty like Billy.”\n\n“All Indians wear the same kind of pants.”\n\n“I didn’t see him at all,” Frank said. “Pa was down into the road and\nback up again before I seen a thing. I thought he was killing a snake.”\n\n“Plenty of Indians’ll kill snakes to-night, I guess,” Joe Garner said.\n\n“Them Indians,” said Mrs. Garner.\n\nThey drove along. The road turned off from the main highway and went up\ninto the hills. It was hard pulling for the horses and the boys got down\nand walked. The road was sandy. Nick looked back from the top of the\nhill by the schoolhouse. He saw the lights of Petoskey and, off across\nLittle Traverse Bay, the lights of Harbour Springs. They climbed back in\nthe wagon again."}
{"text": "“They ought to put some gravel on that stretch,” Joe Garner said. The\nwagon went along the road through the woods. Joe and Mrs. Garner sat\nclose together on the front seat. Nick sat between the two boys. The\nroad came out into a clearing.\n\n“Right here was where Pa ran over the skunk.”\n\n“It was further on.”\n\n“It don’t make no difference where it was,” Joe said without turning his\nhead. “One place is just as good as another to run over a skunk.”\n\n“I saw two skunks last night,” Nick said.\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Down by the lake. They were looking for dead fish along the beach.”\n\n“They were coons probably,” Carl said.\n\n“They were skunks. I guess I know skunks.”\n\n“You ought to,” Carl said. “You got an Indian girl.”\n\n“Stop talking that way, Carl,” said Mrs. Garner.\n\n“Well, they smell about the same.”\n\nJoe Garner laughed.\n\n“You stop laughing, Joe,” Mrs. Garner said. “I won’t have Carl talk that\nway.”\n\n“Have you got an Indian girl, Nickie?” Joe asked.\n\n“No.”\n\n“He has too, Pa,” Frank said. “Prudence Mitchell’s his girl.”\n\n“She’s not.”\n\n“He goes to see her every day.”\n\n“I don’t.” Nick, sitting between the two boys in the dark, felt hollow\nand happy inside himself to be teased about Prudence Mitchell. “She\nain’t my girl,” he said.\n\n“Listen to him,” said Carl. “I see them together every day.”\n\n“Carl can’t get a girl,” his mother said, “not even a squaw.”\n\nCarl was quiet.\n\n“Carl ain’t no good with girls,” Frank said.\n\n“You shut up.”\n\n“You’re all right, Carl,” Joe Garner said. “Girls never got a man\nanywhere. Look at your pa.”\n\n“Yes, that’s what you would say,” Mrs. Garner moved close to Joe as the\nwagon jolted. “Well, you had plenty of girls in your time.”\n\n“I’ll bet Pa wouldn’t ever have had a squaw for a girl.”\n\n“Don’t you think it,” Joe said. “You better watch out to keep Prudie,\nNick.”\n\nHis wife whispered to him and Joe laughed.\n\n“What you laughing at?” asked Frank.\n\n“Don’t you say it, Garner,” his wife warned. Joe laughed again.\n\n“Nickie can have Prudence,” Joe Garner said. “I got a good girl.”\n\n“That’s the way to talk,” Mrs. Garner said.\n\nThe horses were pulling heavily in the sand. Joe reached out in the dark\nwith the whip.\n\n“Come on, pull into it. You’ll have to pull harder than this to-morrow.”\n\nThey trotted down the long hill, the wagon jolting. At the farmhouse\neverybody got down. Mrs. Garner unlocked the door, went inside, and came\nout with a lamp in her hand. Carl and Nick unloaded the things from the\nback of the wagon. Frank sat on the front seat to drive to the barn and\nput up the horses. Nick went up the steps and opened the kitchen door.\nMrs. Garner was building a fire in the stove. She turned from pouring\nkerosene on the wood.\n\n“Good-by, Mrs. Garner,” Nick said. “Thanks for taking me.”\n\n“Oh shucks, Nickie.”\n\n“I had a wonderful time.”\n\n“We like to have you. Won’t you stay and eat some supper?”\n\n“I better go. I think Dad probably waited for me.”\n\n“Well, get along then. Send Carl up to the house, will you?”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Good-night, Nickie.”\n\n“Good-night, Mrs. Garner.”\n\nNick went out the farmyard and down to the barn. Joe and Frank were\nmilking.\n\n“Good-night,” Nick said. “I had a swell time.”\n\n“Good-night, Nick,” Joe Garner called. “Aren’t you going to stay and\neat?”\n\n“No, I can’t. Will you tell Carl his mother wants him?”\n\n“All right. Good-night, Nickie.”\n\nNick walked barefoot along the path through the meadow below the barn.\nThe path was smooth and the dew was cool on his bare feet. He climbed a\nfence at the end of the meadow, went down through a ravine, his feet wet\nin the swamp mud, and then climbed up through the dry beech woods until\nhe saw the lights of the cottage. He climbed over the fence and walked\naround to the front porch. Through the window he saw his father sitting\nby the table, reading in the light from the big lamp. Nick opened the\ndoor and went in.\n\n“Well, Nickie,” his father said, “was it a good day?”\n\n“I had a swell time, Dad. It was a swell Fourth of July.”\n\n“Are you hungry?”\n\n“You bet.”\n\n“What did you do with your shoes?”\n\n“I left them in the wagon at Garner’s.”\n\n“Come on out to the kitchen.”"}
{"text": "Nick’s father went ahead with the lamp. He stopped and lifted the lid of\nthe ice-box. Nick went on into the kitchen. His father brought in a\npiece of cold chicken on a plate and a pitcher of milk and put them on\nthe table before Nick. He put down the lamp.\n\n“There’s some pie too,” he said. “Will that hold you?”\n\n“It’s grand.”\n\nHis father sat down in a chair beside the oilcloth-covered table. He\nmade a big shadow on the kitchen wall.\n\n“Who won the ball game?”\n\n“Petoskey. Five to three.”\n\nHis father sat watching him eat and filled his glass from the\nmilk-pitcher. Nick drank and wiped his mouth on his napkin. His father\nreached over to the shelf for the pie. He cut Nick a big piece. It was\nhuckleberry pie.\n\n“What did you do, Dad?”\n\n“I went out fishing in the morning.”\n\n“What did you get?”\n\n“Only perch.”\n\nHis father sat watching Nick eat the pie.\n\n“What did you do this afternoon?” Nick asked.\n\n“I went for a walk up by the Indian camp.”\n\n“Did you see anybody?”\n\n“The Indians were all in town getting drunk.”\n\n“Didn’t you see anybody at all?”\n\n“I saw your friend, Prudie.”\n\n“Where was she?”\n\n“She was in the woods with Frank Washburn. I ran onto them. They were\nhaving quite a time.”\n\nHis father was not looking at him.\n\n“What were they doing?”\n\n“I didn’t stay to find out.”\n\n“Tell me what they were doing.”\n\n“I don’t know,” his father said. “I just heard them threshing around.”\n\n“How did you know it was them?”\n\n“I saw them.”\n\n“I thought you said you didn’t see them.”\n\n“Oh, yes, I saw them.”\n\n“Who was it with her?” Nick asked.\n\n“Frank Washburn.”\n\n“Were they—were they——”\n\n“Were they what?”\n\n“Were they happy?”\n\n“I guess so.”\n\nHis father got up from the table and went out the kitchen screen door.\nWhen he came back Nick was looking at his plate. He had been crying.\n\n“Have some more?” His father picked up the knife to cut the pie.\n\n“No,” said Nick.\n\n“You better have another piece.”\n\n“No, I don’t want any.”\n\nHis father cleared off the table.\n\n“Where were they in the woods?” Nick asked.\n\n“Up back of the camp.” Nick looked at his plate. His father said, “You\nbetter go to bed, Nick.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nNick went into his room, undressed, and got into bed. He heard his\nfather moving around in the living-room. Nick lay in the bed with his\nface in the pillow.\n\n“My heart’s broken,” he thought. “If I feel this way my heart must be\nbroken.”\n\nAfter a while he heard his father blow out the lamp and go into his own\nroom. He heard a wind come up in the trees outside and felt it come in\ncool through the screen. He lay for a long time with his face in the\npillow, and after a while he forgot to think about Prudence and finally\nhe went to sleep. When he awoke in the night he heard the wind in the\nhemlock trees outside the cottage and the waves of the lake coming in on\nthe shore, and he went back to sleep. In the morning there was a big\nwind blowing and the waves were running high up on the beach and he was\nawake a long time before he remembered that his heart was broken.\n\nTHE train passed very quickly a long, red stone house with a garden and\nfour thick palm-trees with tables under them in the shade. On the other\nside was the sea. Then there was a cutting through red stone and clay,\nand the sea was only occasionally and far below against rocks.\n\n“I bought him in Palermo,” the American lady said. “We only had an hour\nashore and it was Sunday morning. The man wanted to be paid in dollars\nand I gave him a dollar and a half. He really sings very beautifully.”\n\nIt was very hot in the train and it was very hot in the _lit salon_\ncompartment. There was no breeze came through the open window. The\nAmerican lady pulled the window-blind down and there was no more sea,\neven occasionally. On the other side there was glass, then the corridor,\nthen an open window, and outside the window were dusty trees and an\noiled road and flat fields of grapes, with gray-stone hills behind them."}
{"text": "There was smoke from many tall chimneys—coming into Marseilles, and the\ntrain slowed down and followed one track through many others into the\nstation. The train stayed twenty-five minutes in the station at\nMarseilles and the American lady bought a copy of _The Daily Mail_ and a\nhalf-bottle of Evian water. She walked a little way along the station\nplatform, but she stayed near the steps of the car because at Cannes,\nwhere it stopped for twelve minutes, the train had left with no signal\nof departure and she had only gotten on just in time. The American lady\nwas a little deaf and she was afraid that perhaps signals of departure\nwere given and that she did not hear them.\n\nThe train left the station in Marseilles and there was not only the\nswitch-yards and the factory smoke but, looking back, the town of\nMarseilles and the harbor with stone hills behind it and the last of the\nsun on the water. As it was getting dark the train passed a farmhouse\nburning in a field. Motor-cars were stopped along the road and bedding\nand things from inside the farmhouse were spread in the field. Many\npeople were watching the house burn. After it was dark the train was in\nAvignon. People got on and off. At the news-stand Frenchmen, returning\nto Paris, bought that day’s French papers. On the station platform were\nnegro soldiers. They wore brown uniforms and were tall and their faces\nshone, close under the electric light. Their faces were very black and\nthey were too tall to stare. The train left Avignon station with the\nnegroes standing there. A short white sergeant was with them.\n\nInside the _lit salon_ compartment the porter had pulled down the three\nbeds from inside the wall and prepared them for sleeping. In the night\nthe American lady lay without sleeping because the train was a _rapide_\nand went very fast and she was afraid of the speed in the night. The\nAmerican lady’s bed was the one next to the window. The canary from\nPalermo, a cloth spread over his cage, was out of the draft in the\ncorridor that went into the compartment wash-room. There was a blue\nlight outside the compartment, and all night the train went very fast\nand the American lady lay awake and waited for a wreck.\n\nIn the morning the train was near Paris, and after the American lady had\ncome out from the wash-room, looking very wholesome and middle-aged and\nAmerican in spite of not having slept, and had taken the cloth off the\nbirdcage and hung the cage in the sun, she went back to the\nrestaurant-car for breakfast. When she came back to the _lit salon_\ncompartment again, the beds had been pushed back into the wall and made\ninto seats, the canary was shaking his feathers in the sunlight that\ncame through the open window, and the train was much nearer Paris.\n\n“He loves the sun,” the American lady said. “He’ll sing now in a little\nwhile.”\n\nThe canary shook his feathers and pecked into them. “I’ve always loved\nbirds,” the American lady said. “I’m taking him home to my little girl.\nThere—he’s singing now.”\n\nThe canary chirped and the feathers on his throat stood out, then he\ndropped his bill and pecked into his feathers again. The train crossed a\nriver and passed through a very carefully tended forest. The train\npassed through many outside of Paris towns. There were tram-cars in the\ntowns and big advertisements for the Belle Jardinière and Dubonnet and\nPernod on the walls toward the train. All that the train passed through\nlooked as though it were before breakfast. For several minutes I had not\nlistened to the American lady, who was talking to my wife.\n\n“Is your husband American too?” asked the lady.\n\n“Yes,” said my wife. “We’re both Americans.”\n\n“I thought you were English.”\n\n“Oh, no.”\n\n“Perhaps that was because I wore braces,” I said. I had started to say\nsuspenders and changed it to braces in the mouth, to keep my English\ncharacter. The American lady did not hear. She was really quite deaf;\nshe read lips, and I had not looked toward her. I had looked out of the\nwindow. She went on talking to my wife."}
{"text": "“I’m so glad you’re Americans. American men make the best husbands,” the\nAmerican lady was saying. “That was why we left the Continent, you know.\nMy daughter fell in love with a man in Vevey.” She stopped. “They were\nsimply madly in love.” She stopped again. “I took her away, of course.”\n\n“Did she get over it?” asked my wife.\n\n“I don’t think so,” said the American lady. “She wouldn’t eat anything\nand she wouldn’t sleep at all. I’ve tried so very hard, but she doesn’t\nseem to take an interest in anything. She doesn’t care about things. I\ncouldn’t have her marrying a foreigner.” She paused. “Some one, a very\ngood friend, told me once, ‘No foreigner can make an American girl a\ngood husband.’”\n\n“No,” said my wife, “I suppose not.”\n\nThe American lady admired my wife’s travelling-coat, and it turned out\nthat the American lady had bought her own clothes for twenty years now\nfrom the same maison de couturier in the Rue Saint Honoré. They had her\nmeasurements, and a vendeuse who knew her and her tastes picked the\ndresses out for her and they were sent to America. They came to the\npost-office near where she lived up-town in New York, and the duty was\nnever exorbitant because they opened the dresses there in the\npost-office to appraise them and they were always very simple-looking\nand with no gold lace nor ornaments that would make the dresses look\nexpensive. Before the present vendeuse, named Thérèse, there had been\nanother vendeuse, named Amélie. Altogether there had only been these two\nin the twenty years. It had always been the same couturier. Prices,\nhowever, had gone up. The exchange, though, equalized that. They had her\ndaughter’s measurements now too. She was grown up and there was not much\nchance of their changing now.\n\nThe train was now coming into Paris. The fortifications were levelled\nbut grass had not grown. There were many cars standing on tracks—brown\nwooden restaurant-cars and brown wooden sleeping-cars that would go to\nItaly at five o’clock that night, if that train still left at five; the\ncars were marked Paris-Rome, and cars, with seats on the roofs, that\nwent back and forth to the suburbs with, at certain hours, people in all\nthe seats and on the roofs, if that were the way it were still done, and\npassing were the white walls and many windows of houses. Nothing had\neaten any breakfast.\n\n“Americans make the best husbands,” the American lady said to my wife. I\nwas getting down the bags. “American men are the only men in the world\nto marry.”\n\n“How long ago did you leave Vevey?” asked my wife.\n\n“Two years ago this fall. It’s her, you know, that I’m taking the canary\nto.”\n\n“Was the man your daughter was in love with a Swiss?”\n\n“Yes,” said the American lady. “He was from a very good family in Vevey.\nHe was going to be an engineer. They met there in Vevey. They used to go\non long walks together.”\n\n“I know Vevey,” said my wife. “We were there on our honeymoon.”\n\n“Were you really? That must have been lovely. I had no idea, of course,\nthat she’d fall in love with him.”\n\n“It was a very lovely place,” said my wife.\n\n“Yes,” said the American lady. “Isn’t it lovely? Where did you stop\nthere?”\n\n“We stayed at the Trois Couronnes,” said my wife.\n\n“It’s such a fine old hotel,” said the American lady.\n\n“Yes,” said my wife. “We had a very fine room and in the fall the\ncountry was lovely.”\n\n“Were you there in the fall?”\n\n“Yes,” said my wife.\n\nWe were passing three cars that had been in a wreck. They were\nsplintered open and the roofs sagged in.\n\n“Look,” I said. “There’s been a wreck.”\n\nThe American lady looked and saw the last car. “I was afraid of just\nthat all night,” she said. “I have terrific presentiments about things\nsometimes. I’ll never travel on a _rapide_ again at night. There must be\nother comfortable trains that don’t go so fast.”\n\nThen the train was in the dark of the Gare de Lyons, and then stopped\nand porters came up to the windows. I handed bags through the windows,\nand we were out on the dim longness of the platform, and the American\nlady put herself in charge of one of three men from Cook’s who said:\n“Just a moment, madame, and I’ll look for your name.”"}
{"text": "The porter brought a truck and piled on the baggage, and my wife said\ngood-by and I said good-by to the American lady, whose name had been\nfound by the man from Cook’s on a typewritten page in a sheaf of\ntypewritten pages which he replaced in his pocket.\n\nWe followed the porter with the truck down the long cement platform\nbeside the train. At the end was a gate and a man took the tickets.\n\nWe were returning to Paris to set up separate residences.\n\nIT was hot coming down into the valley even in the early morning. The\nsun melted the snow from the skis we were carrying and dried the wood.\nIt was spring in the valley but the sun was very hot. We came along the\nroad into Galtur carrying our skis and rucksacks. As we passed the\nchurchyard a burial was just over. I said, “Grüss Gott,” to the priest\nas he walked past us coming out of the churchyard. The priest bowed.\n\n“It’s funny a priest never speaks to you,” John said.\n\n“You’d think they’d like to say ‘Grüss Gott.’”\n\n“They never answer,” John said.\n\nWe stopped in the road and watched the sexton shovelling in the new\nearth. A peasant with a black beard and high leather boots stood beside\nthe grave. The sexton stopped shovelling and straightened his back. The\npeasant in the high boots took the spade from the sexton and went on\nfilling in the grave—spreading the earth evenly as a man spreading\nmanure in a garden. In the bright May morning the grave-filling looked\nunreal. I could not imagine any one being dead.\n\n“Imagine being buried on a day like this,” I said to John.\n\n“I wouldn’t like it.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “we don’t have to do it.”\n\nWe went on up the road past the houses of the town to the inn. We had\nbeen skiing in the Silvretta for a month, and it was good to be down in\nthe valley. In the Silvretta the skiing had been all right, but it was\nspring skiing, the snow was good only in the early morning and again in\nthe evening. The rest of the time it was spoiled by the sun. We were\nboth tired of the sun. You could not get away from the sun. The only\nshadows were made by rocks or by the hut that was built under the\nprotection of a rock beside a glacier, and in the shade the sweat froze\nin your underclothing. You could not sit outside the hut without dark\nglasses. It was pleasant to be burned black but the sun had been very\ntiring. You could not rest in it. I was glad to be down away from snow.\nIt was too late in the spring to be up in the Silvretta. I was a little\ntired of skiing. We had stayed too long. I could taste the snow water we\nhad been drinking melted off the tin roof of the hut. The taste was a\npart of the way I felt about skiing. I was glad there were other things\nbeside skiing, and I was glad to be down, away from the unnatural high\nmountain spring, into this May morning in the valley.\n\nThe innkeeper sat on the porch of the inn, his chair tipped back against\nthe wall. Beside him sat the cook.\n\n“Ski-heil!” said the innkeeper.\n\n“Heil!” we said and leaned the skis against the wall and took off our\npacks.\n\n“How was it up above?” asked the innkeeper.\n\n“Schön. A little too much sun.”\n\n“Yes. There’s too much sun this time of year.”\n\nThe cook sat on in his chair. The innkeeper went in with us and unlocked\nhis office and brought out our mail. There was a bundle of letters and\nsome papers.\n\n“Let’s get some beer,” John said.\n\n“Good. We’ll drink it inside.”\n\nThe proprietor brought two bottles and we drank them while we read the\nletters.\n\n“We better have some more beer,” John said. A girl brought it this time.\nShe smiled as she opened the bottles.\n\n“Many letters,” she said.\n\n“Yes. Many.”\n\n“Prosit,” she said and went out, taking the empty bottles.\n\n“I’d forgotten what beer tasted like.”\n\n“I hadn’t,” John said. “Up in the hut I used to think about it a lot.”\n\n“Well,” I said, “we’ve got it now.”\n\n“You oughtn’t to ever do anything too long.”\n\n“No. We were up there too long.”\n\n“Too damn long,” John said. “It’s no good doing a thing too long.”"}
{"text": "The sun came through the open window and shone through the beer bottles\non the table. The bottles were half full. There was a little froth on\nthe beer in the bottles, not much because it was very cold. It collared\nup when you poured it into the tall glasses. I looked out of the open\nwindow at the white road. The trees beside the road were dusty. Beyond\nwas a green field and a stream. There were trees along the stream and a\nmill with a water wheel. Through the open side of the mill I saw a long\nlog and a saw in it rising and falling. No one seemed to be tending it.\nThere were four crows walking in the green field. One crow sat in a tree\nwatching. Outside on the porch the cook got off his chair and passed\ninto the hall that led back into the kitchen. Inside, the sunlight shone\nthrough the empty glasses on the table. John was leaning forward with\nhis head on his arms.\n\nThrough the window I saw two men come up the front steps. They came into\nthe drinking room. One was the bearded peasant in the high boots. The\nother was the sexton. They sat down at the table under the window. The\ngirl came in and stood by their table. The peasant did not seem to see\nher. He sat with his hands on the table. He wore his old army clothes.\nThere were patches on the elbows.\n\n“What will it be?” asked the sexton. The peasant did not pay any\nattention.\n\n“What will you drink?”\n\n“Schnapps,” the peasant said.\n\n“And a quarter litre of red wine,” the sexton told the girl.\n\nThe girl brought the drinks and the peasant drank the schnapps. He\nlooked out of the window. The sexton watched him. John had his head\nforward on the table. He was asleep.\n\nThe innkeeper came in and went over to the table. He spoke in dialect\nand the sexton answered him. The peasant looked out of the window. The\ninnkeeper went out of the room. The peasant stood up. He took a folded\nten-thousand kronen note out of a leather pocket-book and unfolded it.\nThe girl came up.\n\n“Alles?” she asked.\n\n“Alles,” he said.\n\n“Let me buy the wine,” the sexton said.\n\n“Alles,” the peasant repeated to the girl. She put her hand in the\npocket of her apron, brought it out full of coins and counted out the\nchange. The peasant went out the door. As soon as he was gone the\ninnkeeper came into the room again and spoke to the sexton. He sat down\nat the table. They talked in dialect. The sexton was amused. The\ninnkeeper was disgusted. The sexton stood up from the table. He was a\nlittle man with a mustache. He leaned out of the window and looked up\nthe road.\n\n“There he goes in,” he said.\n\n“In the Löwen?”\n\n“Ja.”\n\nThey talked again and then the innkeeper came over to our table. The\ninnkeeper was a tall man and old. He looked at John asleep.\n\n“He’s pretty tired.”\n\n“Yes, we were up early.”\n\n“Will you want to eat soon?”\n\n“Any time,” I said. “What is there to eat?”\n\n“Anything you want. The girl will bring the eating-card.”\n\nThe girl brought the menu. John woke up. The menu was written in ink on\na card and the card slipped into a wooden paddle.\n\n“There’s the speise-karte,” I said to John. He looked at it. He was\nstill sleepy.\n\n“Won’t you have a drink with us?” I asked the innkeeper. He sat down.\n“Those peasants are beasts,” said the innkeeper.\n\n“We saw that one at a funeral coming into town.”\n\n“That was his wife.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“He’s a beast. All these peasants are beasts.”\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\n“You wouldn’t believe it. You wouldn’t believe what just happened about\nthat one.”\n\n“Tell me.”\n\n“You wouldn’t believe it.” The innkeeper spoke to the sexton. “Franz,\ncome over here.” The sexton came, bringing his little bottle of wine and\nhis glass.\n\n“The gentlemen are just come down from the Wiesbadenerhütte,” the\ninnkeeper said. We shook hands.\n\n“What will you drink?” I asked.\n\n“Nothing,” Franz shook his finger.\n\n“Another quarter litre?”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Do you understand dialect?” the innkeeper asked.\n\n“No.”\n\n“What’s it all about?” John asked.\n\n“He’s going to tell us about the peasant we saw filling the grave,\ncoming into town.”\n\n“I can’t understand it, anyway,” John said. “It goes too fast for me.”\n\n“That peasant,” the innkeeper said, “to-day he brought his wife in to be\nburied. She died last November.”\n\n“December,” said the sexton."}
{"text": "“That makes nothing. She died last December then, and he notified the\ncommune.”\n\n“December eighteenth,” said the sexton.\n\n“Anyway, he couldn’t bring her over to be buried until the snow was\ngone.”\n\n“He lives on the other side of the Paznaun,” said the sexton. “But he\nbelongs to this parish.”\n\n“He couldn’t bring her out at all?” I asked.\n\n“No. He can only come, from where he lives, on skis until the snow\nmelts. So to-day he brought her in to be buried and the priest, when he\nlooked at her face, didn’t want to bury her. You go on and tell it,” he\nsaid to the sexton. “Speak German, not dialect.”\n\n“It was very funny with the priest,” said the sexton. “In the report to\nthe commune she died of heart trouble. We knew she had heart trouble\nhere. She used to faint in church sometimes. She did not come for a long\ntime. She wasn’t strong to climb. When the priest uncovered her face he\nasked Olz, ‘Did your wife suffer much?’ ‘No,’ said Olz. ‘When I came in\nthe house she was dead across the bed.’\n\n“The priest looked at her again. He didn’t like it.\n\n“‘How did her face get that way?’\n\n“‘I don’t know,’ Olz said.\n\n“‘You’d better find out,’ the priest said, and put the blanket back. Olz\ndidn’t say anything. The priest looked at him. Olz looked back at the\npriest. ‘You want to know?’\n\n“‘I must know,’ the priest said.”\n\n“This is where it’s good,” the innkeeper said. “Listen to this. Go on\nFranz.”\n\n“‘Well,’ said Olz, ‘when she died I made the report to the commune and I\nput her in the shed across the top of the big wood. When I started to\nuse the big wood she was stiff and I put her up against the wall. Her\nmouth was open and when I came into the shed at night to cut up the big\nwood, I hung the lantern from it.’\n\n“‘Why did you do that?’ asked the priest.\n\n“‘I don’t know,’ said Olz.\n\n“‘Did you do that many times?’\n\n“‘Every time I went to work in the shed at night.’\n\n“‘It was very wrong,’ said the priest. ‘Did you love your wife?’\n\n“‘Ja, I loved her,’ Olz said. ‘I loved her fine.’”\n\n“Did you understand it all?” asked the innkeeper. “You understand it all\nabout his wife?”\n\n“I heard it.”\n\n“How about eating?” John asked.\n\n“You order,” I said. “Do you think it’s true?” I asked the innkeeper.\n\n“Sure it’s true,” he said. “These peasants are beasts.”\n\n“Where did he go now?”\n\n“He’s gone to drink at my colleague’s, the Löwen.”\n\n“He didn’t want to drink with me,” said the sexton.\n\n“He didn’t want to drink with me, after he knew about his wife,” said\nthe innkeeper.\n\n“Say,” said John. “How about eating?”\n\n“All right,” I said.\n\nWILLIAM CAMPBELL had been in a pursuit race with a burlesque show ever\nsince Pittsburgh. In a pursuit race, in bicycle racing, riders start at\nequal intervals to ride after one another. They ride very fast because\nthe race is usually limited to a short distance and if they slow their\nriding another rider who maintains his pace will make up the space that\nseparated them equally at the start. As soon as a rider is caught and\npassed he is out of the race and must get down from his bicycle and\nleave the track. If none of the riders are caught the winner of the race\nis the one who has gained the most distance. In most pursuit races, if\nthere are only two riders, one of the riders is caught inside of six\nmiles. The burlesque show caught William Campbell at Kansas City.\n\nWilliam Campbell had hoped to hold a slight lead over the burlesque show\nuntil they reached the Pacific coast. As long as he preceded the\nburlesque show as advance man he was being paid. When the burlesque show\ncaught up with him he was in bed. He was in bed when the manager of the\nburlesque troupe came into his room and after the manager had gone out\nhe decided that he might as well stay in bed. It was very cold in Kansas\nCity and he was in no hurry to go out. He did not like Kansas City. He\nreached under the bed for a bottle and drank. It made his stomach feel\nbetter. Mr. Turner, the manager of the burlesque show, had refused a\ndrink."}
{"text": "William Campbell’s interview with Mr. Turner had been a little strange.\nMr. Turner had knocked on the door. Campbell had said: “Come in!” When\nMr. Turner came into the room he saw clothing on a chair, an open\nsuitcase, the bottle on a chair beside the bed, and some one lying in\nthe bed completely covered by the bed-clothes.\n\n“Mister Campbell,” Mr. Turner said.\n\n“You can’t fire me,” William Campbell said from underneath the covers.\nIt was warm and white and close under the covers. “You can’t fire me\nbecause I’ve got down off my bicycle.”\n\n“You’re drunk,” Mr. Turner said.\n\n“Oh, yes,” William Campbell said, speaking directly against the sheet\nand feeling the texture with his lips.\n\n“You’re a fool,” Mr. Turner said. He turned off the electric light. The\nelectric light had been burning all night. It was now ten o’clock in the\nmorning. “You’re a drunken fool. When did you get into this town?”\n\n“I got into this town last night,” William Campbell said, speaking\nagainst the sheet. He found he liked to talk through a sheet. “Did you\never talk through a sheet?”\n\n“Don’t try to be funny. You aren’t funny.”\n\n“I’m not being funny. I’m just talking through a sheet.”\n\n“You’re talking through a sheet all right.”\n\n“You can go now, Mr. Turner,” Campbell said. “I don’t work for you any\nmore.”\n\n“You know that anyway.”\n\n“I know a lot,” William Campbell said. He pulled down the sheet and\nlooked at Mr. Turner. “I know enough so I don’t mind looking at you at\nall. Do you want to hear what I know?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Good,” said William Campbell. “Because really I don’t know anything at\nall. I was just talking.” He pulled the sheet up over his face again. “I\nlove it under a sheet,” he said. Mr. Turner stood beside the bed. He was\na middle-aged man with a large stomach and a bald head and he had many\nthings to do. “You ought to stop off here, Billy, and take a cure,” he\nsaid. “I’ll fix it up if you want to do it.”\n\n“I don’t want to take a cure,” William Campbell said. “I don’t want to\ntake a cure at all. I am perfectly happy. All my life I have been\nperfectly happy.”\n\n“How long have you been this way?”\n\n“What a question!” William Campbell breathed in and out through the\nsheet.\n\n“How long have you been stewed, Billy?”\n\n“Haven’t I done my work?”\n\n“Sure. I just asked you how long you’ve been stewed, Billy.”\n\n“I don’t know. But I’ve got my wolf back,” he touched the sheet with his\ntongue. “I’ve had him for a week.”\n\n“The hell you have.”\n\n“Oh, yes. My dear wolf. Every time I take a drink he goes outside the\nroom. He can’t stand alcohol. The poor little fellow.” He moved his\ntongue round and round on the sheet. “He’s a lovely wolf. He’s just like\nhe always was.” William Campbell shut his eyes and took a deep breath.\n\n“You got to take a cure, Billy,” Mr. Turner said. “You won’t mind the\nKeeley. It isn’t bad.”\n\n“The Keeley,” William Campbell said. “It isn’t far from London.” He shut\nhis eyes and opened them, moving the eyelashes against the sheet. “I\njust love sheets,” he said. He looked at Mr. Turner.\n\n“Listen, you think I’m drunk.”\n\n“You _are_ drunk.”\n\n“No, I’m not.”\n\n“You’re drunk and you’ve had dt’s.”\n\n“No.” William Campbell held the sheet around his head. “Dear sheet,” he\nsaid. He breathed against it gently. “Pretty sheet. You love me, don’t\nyou, sheet? It’s all in the price of the room. Just like in Japan. No,”\nhe said. “Listen Billy, dear Sliding Billy, I have a surprise for you.\nI’m not drunk. I’m hopped to the eyes.”\n\n“No,” said Mr. Turner.\n\n“Take a look.” William Campbell pulled up the right sleeve of his pyjama\njacket under the sheet, then shoved the right forearm out. “Look at\nthat.” On the forearm, from just above the wrist to the elbow, were\nsmall blue circles around tiny dark blue punctures. The circles almost\ntouched one another. “That’s the new development,” William Campbell\nsaid. “I drink a little now once in a while, just to drive the wolf out\nof the room.”\n\n“They got a cure for that, ‘Sliding Billy’” Turner said.\n\n“No,” William Campbell said. “They haven’t got a cure for anything.”\n\n“You can’t just quit like that, Billy,” Turner said. He sat on the bed.\n\n“Be careful of my sheet,” William Campbell said."}
{"text": "“You can’t just quit at your age and take to pumping yourself full of\nthat stuff just because you got in a jam.”\n\n“There’s a law against it. If that’s what you mean.”\n\n“No, I mean you got to fight it out.”\n\nBilly Campbell caressed the sheet with his lips and his tongue. “Dear\nsheet,” he said. “I can kiss this sheet and see right through it at the\nsame time.”\n\n“Cut it out about the sheet. You can’t just take to that stuff, Billy.”\n\nWilliam Campbell shut his eyes. He was beginning to feel a slight\nnausea. He knew that this nausea would increase steadily, without there\never being the relief of sickness, until something were done against it.\nIt was at this point that he suggested that Mr. Turner have a drink. Mr.\nTurner declined. William Campbell took a drink from the bottle. It was a\ntemporary measure. Mr. Turner watched him. Mr. Turner had been in this\nroom much longer than he should have been, he had many things to do;\nalthough living in daily association with people who used drugs, he had\na horror of drugs, and he was very fond of William Campbell; he did not\nwish to leave him. He was very sorry for him and he felt a cure might\nhelp. He knew there were good cures in Kansas City. But he had to go. He\nstood up.\n\n“Listen, Billy,” William Campbell said, “I want to tell you something.\nYou’re called ‘Sliding Billy.’ That’s because you can slide. I’m called\njust Billy. That’s because I never could slide at all. I can’t slide,\nBilly. I can’t slide. It just catches. Every time I try it, it catches.”\nHe shut his eyes. “I can’t slide, Billy. It’s awful when you can’t\nslide.”\n\n“Yes,” said “Sliding Billy” Turner.\n\n“Yes, what?” William Campbell looked at him.\n\n“You were saying.”\n\n“No,” said William Campbell. “I wasn’t saying. It must have been a\nmistake.”\n\n“You were saying about sliding.”\n\n“No. It couldn’t have been about sliding. But listen, Billy, and I’ll\ntell you a secret. Stick to sheets, Billy. Keep away from women and\nhorses and, and—” he stopped “—eagles, Billy. If you love horses\nyou’ll get horse-s—, and if you love eagles you’ll get eagle-s—.” He\nstopped and put his head under the sheet.\n\n“I got to go,” said “Sliding Billy” Turner.\n\n“If you love women you’ll get a dose,” William Campbell said. “If you\nlove horses——”\n\n“Yes, you said that.”\n\n“Said what?”\n\n“About horses and eagles.”\n\n“Oh, yes. And if you love sheets.” He breathed on the sheet and stroked\nhis nose against it. “I don’t know about sheets,” he said. “I just\nstarted to love this sheet.”\n\n“I have to go,” Mr. Turner said. “I got a lot to do.”\n\n“That’s all right,” William Campbell said. “Everybody’s got to go.”\n\n“I better go.”\n\n“All right, you go.”\n\n“Are you all right, Billy?”\n\n“I was never so happy in my life.”\n\n“And you’re all right?”\n\n“I’m fine. You go along. I’ll just lie here for a little while. Around\nnoon I’ll get up.”\n\nBut when Mr. Turner came up to William Campbell’s room at noon William\nCampbell was sleeping and as Mr. Turner was a man who knew what things\nin life were very valuable he did not wake him.\n\n_Three Roman soldiers are in a drinking-place at eleven o’clock\n    at night.

Any time you show me one that doesn’t want to get down off the\ncross when the time comes—when the time comes, I mean—I’ll climb right\nup with him.\n\n_1st Soldier_—I thought he was pretty good in there to-day.\n\n_3d Soldier_—He was all right.\n\n_2d Roman Soldier_—You guys don’t know what I’m talking about. I’m not\nsaying whether he was good or not. What I mean is, when the time comes.\nWhen they first start nailing him, there isn’t none of them wouldn’t\nstop it if they could.\n\n_1st Soldier_—Didn’t you follow it, George?\n\n_Wine-seller_—No, I didn’t take any interest in it, Lootenant.\n\n_1st Soldier_—I was surprised how he acted.\n\n_3d Soldier_—The part I don’t like is the nailing them on. You know,\nthat must get to you pretty bad.\n\n_2d Soldier_—It isn’t that that’s so bad, as when they first lift ’em\nup.

That’s when it gets ’em.\n\n_3d Roman Soldier_—It takes some of them pretty bad.\n\n_1st Soldier_—Ain’t I seen ’em? I seen plenty of them.

Inside, the electric stove seemed to give no heat\nand rising from his writing-table, he sat down upon the stove. How good\nit felt! Here, at last, was life.\n\nHe reached for another orange. Far away in Paris, Mascart had knocked\nDanny Frush cuckoo in the second round. Far off in Mesopotamia,\ntwenty-one feet of snow had fallen. Across the world in distant\nAustralia, the English cricketers were sharpening up their wickets.\n_There_ was Romance.\n\nPatrons of the arts and letters have discovered _The Forum_, he read. It\nis the guide, philosopher, and friend of the thinking minority. Prize\nshort-stories—will their authors write our best-sellers of to-morrow?\n\nYou will enjoy these warm, homespun, American tales, bits of real life\non the open ranch, in crowded tenement or comfortable home, and all with\na healthy undercurrent of humor.\n\nI must read them, he thought.\n\nHe read on. Our children’s children—what of them? Who of them? New\nmeans must be discovered to find room for us under the sun. Shall this\nbe done by war or can it be done by peaceful methods?\n\nOr will we all have to move to Canada?\n\nOur deepest convictions—will Science upset them? Our civilization—is\nit inferior to older orders of things?\n\nAnd meanwhile, in the far-off dripping jungles of Yucatan, sounded the\nchopping of the axes of the gum-choppers.\n\nDo we want big men—or do we want them cultured? Take Joyce. Take\nPresident Coolidge. What star must our college students aim at? There is\nJack Britton. There is Dr. Henry Van Dyke. Can we reconcile the two?\nTake the case of Young Stribling.\n\nAnd what of our daughters who must make their own Soundings? Nancy\nHawthorne is obliged to make her own Soundings in the sea of life.\nBravely and sensibly she faces the problems which come to every girl of\neighteen.\n\nIt was a splendid booklet.\n\nAre you a girl of eighteen? Take the case of Joan of Arc. Take the case\nof Bernard Shaw. Take the case of Betsy Ross.\n\nThink of these things in 1925—Was there a risqué page in Puritan\nhistory? Were there two sides to Pocahontas? Did he have a fourth\ndimension?\n\nAre modern paintings—and poetry—Art? Yes and No. Take Picasso.\n\nHave tramps codes of conduct? Send your mind adventuring.\n\nThere is Romance everywhere. _Forum_ writers talk to the point, are\npossessed of humor and wit. But they do not try to be smart and are\nnever long-winded.\n\nLive the full life of the mind, exhilarated by new ideas, intoxicated by\nthe Romance of the unusual. He laid down the booklet.\n\nAnd meanwhile, stretched flat on a bed in a darkened room in his house\nin Triana, Manuel Garcia Maera lay with a tube in each lung, drowning\nwith the pneumonia. All the papers in Andalucia devoted special\nsupplements to his death, which had been expected for some days. Men and\nboys bought full-length colored pictures of him to remember him by, and\nlost the picture they had of him in their memories by looking at the\nlithographs. Bull-fighters were very relieved he was dead, because he\ndid always in the bull-ring the things they could only do sometimes.\nThey all marched in the rain behind his coffin and there were one\nhundred and forty-seven bull-fighters followed him out to the cemetery,\nwhere they buried him in the tomb next to Joselito. After the funeral\nevery one sat in the cafés out of the rain, and many colored pictures of\nMaera were sold to men who rolled them up and put them away in their\npockets."}
{"text": "THAT night we lay on the floor in the room and I listened to the\nsilk-worms eating. The silk-worms fed in racks of mulberry leaves and\nall night you could hear them eating and a dropping sound in the leaves.\nI myself did not want to sleep because I had been living for a long time\nwith the knowledge that if I ever shut my eyes in the dark and let\nmyself go, my soul would go out of my body. I had been that way for a\nlong time, ever since I had been blown up at night and felt it go out of\nme and go off and then come back. I tried never to think about it, but\nit had started to go since, in the nights, just at the moment of going\noff to sleep, and I could only stop it by a very great effort. So while\nnow I am fairly sure that it would not really have gone out, yet then,\nthat summer, I was unwilling to make the experiment.\n\nI had different ways of occupying myself while I lay awake. I would\nthink of a trout stream I had fished along when I was a boy and fish its\nwhole length very carefully in my mind; fishing very carefully under all\nthe logs, all the turns of the bank, the deep holes and the clear\nshallow stretches, sometimes catching trout and sometimes losing them. I\nwould stop fishing at noon to eat my lunch; sometimes on a log over the\nstream; sometimes on a high bank under a tree, and I always ate my lunch\nvery slowly and watched the stream below me while I ate. Often I ran out\nof bait because I would take only ten worms with me in a tobacco tin\nwhen I started. When I had used them all I had to find more worms, and\nsometimes it was very difficult digging in the bank of the stream where\nthe cedar trees kept out the sun and there was no grass but only the\nbare moist earth and often I could find no worms. Always though I found\nsome kind of bait, but one time in the swamp I could find no bait at all\nand had to cut up one of the trout I had caught and use him for bait.\n\nSometimes I found insects in the swamp meadows, in the grass or under\nferns, and used them. There were beetles and insects with legs like\ngrass stems, and grubs in old rotten logs; white grubs with brown\npinching heads that would not stay on the hook and emptied into nothing\nin the cold water, and wood ticks under logs where sometimes I found\nangle-worms that slipped into the ground as soon as the log was raised.\nOnce I used a salamander from under an old log. The salamander was very\nsmall and neat and agile and a lovely color. He had tiny feet that tried\nto hold on to the hook, and after that one time I never used a\nsalamander, although I found them very often. Nor did I use crickets,\nbecause of the way they acted about the hook.\n\nSometimes the stream ran through an open meadow, and in the dry grass I\nwould catch grasshoppers and use them for bait and sometimes I would\ncatch grasshoppers and toss them into the stream and watch them float\nalong swimming on the stream and circling on the surface as the current\ntook them and then disappear as a trout rose. Sometimes I would fish\nfour or five different streams in the night; starting as near as I could\nget to their source and fishing them down stream. When I had finished\ntoo quickly and the time did not go, I would fish the stream over again,\nstarting where it emptied into the lake and fishing back up stream,\ntrying for all the trout I had missed coming down. Some nights too I\nmade up streams, and some of them were very exciting, and it was like\nbeing awake and dreaming. Some of those streams I still remember and\nthink that I have fished in them, and they are confused with streams I\nreally know. I gave them all names and went to them on the train and\nsometimes walked for miles to get to them."}
{"text": "But some nights I could not fish, and on those nights I was cold-awake\nand said my prayers over and over and tried to pray for all the people I\nhad ever known. That took up a great amount of time, for if you try to\nremember all the people you have ever known, going back to the earliest\nthing you remember—which was, with me, the attic of the house where I\nwas born and my mother and father’s wedding-cake in a tin box hanging\nfrom one of the rafters, and, in the attic, jars of snakes and other\nspecimens that my father had collected as a boy and preserved in\nalcohol, the alcohol sunken in the jars so the backs of some of the\nsnakes and specimens were exposed and had turned white—if you thought\nback that far, you remembered a great many people. If you prayed for all\nof them, saying a Hail Mary and an Our Father for each one, it took a\nlong time and finally it would be light, and then you could go to sleep,\nif you were in a place where you could sleep in the daylight.\n\nOn those nights I tried to remember everything that had ever happened to\nme, starting with just before I went to the war and remembering back\nfrom one thing to another. I found I could only remember back to that\nattic in my grandfather’s house. Then I would start there and remember\nthis way again, until I reached the war.\n\nI remembered, after my grandfather died we moved away from that house\nand to a new house designed and built by my mother. Many things that\nwere not to be moved were burned in the back-yard and I remember those\njars from the attic being thrown in the fire, and how they popped in the\nheat and the fire flamed up from the alcohol. I remember the snakes\nburning in the fire in the back-yard. But there were no people in that,\nonly things. I could not remember who burned the things even, and I\nwould go on until I came to people and then stop and pray for them.\n\nAbout the new house I remembered how my mother was always cleaning\nthings out and making a good clearance. One time when my father was away\non a hunting trip she made a good thorough cleaning out in the basement\nand burned everything that should not have been there. When my father\ncame home and got down from his buggy and hitched the horse, the fire\nwas still burning in the road beside the house. I went out to meet him.\nHe handed me his shotgun and looked at the fire. “What’s this?” he\nasked.\n\n“I’ve been cleaning out the basement, dear,” my mother said from the\nporch. She was standing there smiling, to meet him. My father looked at\nthe fire and kicked at something. Then he leaned over and picked\nsomething out of the ashes. “Get a rake, Nick,” he said to me. I went to\nthe basement and brought a rake and my father raked very carefully in\nthe ashes. He raked out stone axes and stone skinning knives and tools\nfor making arrow-heads and pieces of pottery and many arrow-heads. They\nhad all been blackened and chipped by the fire. My father raked them all\nout very carefully and spread them on the grass by the road. His shotgun\nin its leather case and his game-bags were on the grass where he had\nleft them when he stepped down from the buggy.\n\n“Take the gun and the bags in the house, Nick, and bring me a paper,” he\nsaid. My mother had gone inside the house. I took the shotgun, which was\nheavy to carry and banged against my legs, and the two game-bags and\nstarted toward the house. “Take them one at a time,” my father said.\n“Don’t try and carry too much at once.” I put down the game-bags and\ntook in the shotgun and brought out a newspaper from the pile in my\nfather’s office. My father spread all the blackened, chipped stone\nimplements on the paper and then wrapped them up. “The best arrow-heads\nwent all to pieces,” he said. He walked into the house with the paper\npackage and I stayed outside on the grass with the two game-bags. After\na while I took them in. In remembering that, there were only two people,\nso I would pray for them both."}
{"text": "Some nights, though, I could not remember my prayers even. I could only\nget as far as “On earth as it is in heaven” and then have to start all\nover and be absolutely unable to get past that. Then I would have to\nrecognize that I could not remember and give up saying my prayers that\nnight and try something else. So on some nights I would try to remember\nall the animals in the world by name and then the birds and then fishes\nand then countries and cities and then kinds of food and the names of\nall the streets I could remember in Chicago, and when I could not\nremember anything at all any more I would just listen. And I do not\nremember a night on which you could not hear things. If I could have a\nlight I was not afraid to sleep, because I knew my soul would only go\nout of me if it were dark. So, of course, many nights I was where I\ncould have a light and then I slept because I was nearly always tired\nand often very sleepy. And I am sure many times too that I slept without\nknowing it—but I never slept knowing it, and on this night I listened\nto the silk-worms. You can hear silk-worms eating very clearly in the\nnight and I lay with my eyes open and listened to them.\n\nThere was only one other person in the room and he was awake too. I\nlistened to him being awake, for a long time. He could not lie as\nquietly as I could because, perhaps, he had not had as much practice\nbeing awake. We were lying on blankets spread over straw and when he\nmoved the straw was noisy, but the silk-worms were not frightened by any\nnoise we made and ate on steadily. There were the noises of night seven\nkilometres behind the lines outside but they were different from the\nsmall noises inside the room in the dark. The other man in the room\ntried lying quietly. Then he moved again. I moved too, so he would know\nI was awake. He had lived ten years in Chicago. They had taken him for a\nsoldier in nineteen fourteen when he had come back to visit his family,\nand they had given him to me for an orderly because he spoke English. I\nheard him listening, so I moved again in the blankets.\n\n“Can’t you sleep, Signor Tenente?” he asked.\n\n“No.”\n\n“I can’t sleep, either.”\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“I don’t know. I can’t sleep.”\n\n“You feel all right?”\n\n“Sure. I feel good. I just can’t sleep.”\n\n“You want to talk a while?” I asked.\n\n“Sure. What can you talk about in this damn place.”\n\n“This place is pretty good,” I said.\n\n“Sure,” he said. “It’s all right.”\n\n“Tell me about out in Chicago,” I said.\n\n“Oh,” he said, “I told you all that once.”\n\n“Tell me about how you got married.”\n\n“I told you that.”\n\n“Was the letter you got Monday—from her?”\n\n“Sure. She writes me all the time. She’s making good money with the\nplace.”\n\n“You’ll have a nice place when you go back.”\n\n“Sure. She runs it fine. She’s making a lot of money.”\n\n“Don’t you think we’ll wake them up, talking?” I asked.\n\n“No. They can’t hear. Anyway, they sleep like pigs. I’m different,” he\nsaid. “I’m nervous.”\n\n“Talk quiet,” I said. “Want a smoke?”\n\nWe smoked skilfully in the dark.\n\n“You don’t smoke much, Signor Tenente.”\n\n“No. I’ve just about cut it out.”\n\n“Well,” he said, “it don’t do you any good and I suppose you get so you\ndon’t miss it. Did you ever hear a blind man won’t smoke because he\ncan’t see the smoke come out?”\n\n“I don’t believe it.”\n\n“I think it’s all bull, myself,” he said. “I just heard it somewhere.\nYou know how you hear things.”\n\nWe were both quiet and I listened to the silk-worms.\n\n“You hear those damn silk-worms?” he asked. “You can hear them chew.”\n\n“It’s funny,” I said.\n\n“Say, Signor Tenente, is there something really the matter that you\ncan’t sleep? I never see you sleep. You haven’t slept nights ever since\nI been with you.”\n\n“I don’t know, John,” I said. “I got in pretty bad shape along early\nlast spring and at night it bothers me.”\n\n“Just like I am,” he said. “I shouldn’t have ever got in this war. I’m\ntoo nervous.”\n\n“Maybe it will get better.”\n\n“Say, Signor Tenente, what did you get in this war for, anyway?”\n\n“I don’t know, John. I wanted to, then.”\n\n“Wanted to,” he said. “That’s a hell of a reason.”\n\n“We oughtn’t to talk out loud,” I said."}
{"text": "“They sleep just like pigs,” he said. “They can’t understand the English\nlanguage, anyway. They don’t know a damn thing. What are you going to do\nwhen it’s over and we go back to the States?”\n\n“I’ll get a job on a paper.”\n\n“In Chicago?”\n\n“Maybe.”\n\n“Do you ever read what this fellow Brisbane writes? My wife cuts it out\nfor me and sends it to me.”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“Did you ever meet him?”\n\n“No, but I’ve seen him.”\n\n“I’d like to meet that fellow. He’s a fine writer.

One of the girls is in the fourth grade now. You know,\nSignor Tenente, if I didn’t have the kids I wouldn’t be your orderly\nnow. They’d have made me stay in the line all the time.”\n\n“I’m glad you’ve got them.”\n\n“So am I. They’re fine kids but I want a boy. Three girls and no boy.\nThat’s a hell of a note.”\n\n“Why don’t you try and go to sleep.”\n\n“No, I can’t sleep now. I’m wide awake now, Signor Tenente. Say, I’m\nworried about you not sleeping though.”\n\n“It’ll be all right, John.”\n\n“Imagine a young fellow like you not to sleep.”\n\n“I’ll get all right. It just takes a while.”\n\n“You got to get all right. A man can’t get along that don’t sleep. Do\nyou worry about anything? You got anything on your mind?”\n\n“No, John, I don’t think so.”\n\n“You ought to get married, Signor Tenente. Then you wouldn’t worry.”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“You ought to get married. Why don’t you pick out some nice Italian girl\nwith plenty of money. You could get any one you want. You’re young and\nyou got good decorations and you look nice. You been wounded a couple of\ntimes.”\n\n“I can’t talk the language well enough.”\n\n“You talk it fine. To hell with talking the language. You don’t have to\ntalk to them. Marry them.”\n\n“I’ll think about it.”\n\n“You know some girls, don’t you?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“Well, you marry the one with the most money. Over here, the way they’re\nbrought up, they’ll all make you a good wife.”\n\n“I’ll think about it.”\n\n“Don’t think about it, Signor Tenente. Do it.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“A man ought to be married. You’ll never regret it. Every man ought to\nbe married.”\n\n“All right,” I said. “Let’s try and sleep a while.”\n\n“All right, Signor Tenente. I’ll try it again. But you remember what I\nsaid.”\n\n“I’ll remember it,” I said. “Now let’s sleep a while, John.”\n\n“All right,” he said. “I hope you sleep, Signor Tenente.”\n\nI heard him roll in his blankets on the straw and then he was very quiet\nand I listened to him breathing regularly. Then he started to snore. I\nlistened to him snore for a long time and then I stopped listening to\nhim snore and listened to the silk-worms eating. They ate steadily,\nmaking a dropping in the leaves. I had a new thing to think about and I\nlay in the dark with my eyes open and thought of all the girls I had\never known and what kind of wives they would make. It was a very\ninteresting thing to think about and for a while it killed off\ntrout-fishing and interfered with my prayers. Finally, though, I went\nback to trout-fishing, because I found that I could remember all the\nstreams and there was always something new about them, while the girls,\nafter I had thought about them a few times, blurred and I could not call\nthem into my mind and finally they all blurred and all became rather the\nsame and I gave up thinking about them almost altogether. But I kept on\nwith my prayers and I prayed very often for John in the nights and his\nclass was removed from active service before the October offensive. I\nwas glad he was not there, because he would have been a great worry to\nme. He came to the hospital in Milan to see me several months after and\nwas very disappointed that I had not yet married, and I know he would\nfeel very badly if he knew that, so far, I have never married. He was\ngoing back to America and he was very certain about marriage and knew it\nwould fix up everything.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nMisspelled words and printer errors have been corrected.

{"text": "In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that\nlooked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of\nthe river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and\nthe water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops\nwent by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered\nthe leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the\nleaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the\nroad and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and\nthe soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for\nthe leaves.\n\nThe plain was rich with crops; there were many orchards of fruit trees\nand beyond the plain the mountains were brown and bare. There was\nfighting in the mountains and at night we could see the flashes from the\nartillery. In the dark it was like summer lightning, but the nights were\ncool and there was not the feeling of a storm coming.\n\nSometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching under the window and\nguns going past pulled by motor-tractors. There was much traffic at\nnight and many mules on the roads with boxes of ammunition on each side\nof their pack-saddles and gray motor-trucks that carried men, and other\ntrucks with loads covered with canvas that moved slower in the traffic.\nThere were big guns too that passed in the day drawn by tractors, the\nlong barrels of the guns covered with green branches and green leafy\nbranches and vines laid over the tractors. To the north we could look\nacross a valley and see a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another\nmountain on this side of the river. There was fighting for that mountain\ntoo, but it was not successful, and in the fall when the rains came the\nleaves all fell from the chestnut trees and the branches were bare and\nthe trunks black with rain. The vineyards were thin and bare-branched\ntoo and all the country wet and brown and dead with the autumn. There\nwere mists over the river and clouds on the mountain and the trucks\nsplashed mud on the road and the troops were muddy and wet in their\ncapes; their rifles were wet and under their capes the two leather\ncartridge-boxes on the front of the belts, gray leather boxes heavy with\nthe packs of clips of thin, long 6.5 mm. cartridges, bulged forward\nunder the capes so that the men, passing on the road, marched as though\nthey were six months gone with child.\n\nThere were small gray motor-cars that passed going very fast; usually\nthere was an officer on the seat with the driver and more officers in\nthe back seat. They splashed more mud than the camions even and if one\nof the officers in the back was very small and sitting between two\ngenerals, he himself so small that you could not see his face but only\nthe top of his cap and his narrow back, and if the car went especially\nfast it was probably the King. He lived in Udine and came out in this\nway nearly every day to see how things were going, and things went very\nbadly.\n\nAt the start of the winter came the permanent rain and with the rain\ncame the cholera. But it was checked and in the end only seven thousand\ndied of it in the army."}
{"text": "The next year there were many victories. The mountain that was beyond\nthe valley and the hillside where the chestnut forest grew was captured\nand there were victories beyond the plain on the plateau to the south\nand we crossed the river in August and lived in a house in Gorizia that\nhad a fountain and many thick shady trees in a walled garden and a\nwistaria vine purple on the side of the house. Now the fighting was in\nthe next mountains beyond and was not a mile away. The town was very\nnice and our house was very fine. The river ran behind us and the town\nhad been captured very handsomely but the mountains beyond it could not\nbe taken and I was very glad the Austrians seemed to want to come back\nto the town some time, if the war should end, because they did not\nbombard it to destroy it but only a little in a military way. People\nlived on in it and there were hospitals and cafés and artillery up side\nstreets and two bawdy houses, one for troops and one for officers, and\nwith the end of the summer, the cool nights, the fighting in the\nmountains beyond the town, the shell-marked iron of the railway bridge,\nthe smashed tunnel by the river where the fighting had been, the trees\naround the square and the long avenue of trees that led to the square;\nthese with there being girls in the town, the King passing in his motor\ncar, sometimes now seeing his face and little long necked body and gray\nbeard like a goat’s chin tuft; all these with the sudden interiors of\nhouses that had lost a wall through shelling, with plaster and rubble in\ntheir gardens and sometimes in the street, and the whole thing going\nwell on the Carso made the fall very different from the last fall when\nwe had been in the country. The war was changed too.\n\nThe forest of oak trees on the mountain beyond the town was gone. The\nforest had been green in the summer when we had come into the town but\nnow there were the stumps and the broken trunks and the ground torn up,\nand one day at the end of the fall when I was out where the oak forest\nhad been I saw a cloud coming over the mountain. It came very fast and\nthe sun went a dull yellow and then everything was gray and the sky was\ncovered and the cloud came on down the mountain and suddenly we were in\nit and it was snow. The snow slanted across the wind, the bare ground\nwas covered, the stumps of trees projected, there was snow on the guns\nand there were paths in the snow going back to the latrines behind\ntrenches.\n\nLater, below in the town, I watched the snow falling, looking out of the\nwindow of the bawdy house, the house for officers, where I sat with a\nfriend and two glasses drinking a bottle of Asti, and, looking out at\nthe snow falling slowly and heavily, we knew it was all over for that\nyear. Up the river the mountains had not been taken; none of the\nmountains beyond the river had been taken. That was all left for next\nyear. My friend saw the priest from our mess going by in the street,\nwalking carefully in the slush, and pounded on the window to attract his\nattention. The priest looked up. He saw us and smiled. My friend\nmotioned for him to come in. The priest shook his head and went on. That\nnight in the mess after the spaghetti course, which every one ate very\nquickly and seriously, lifting the spaghetti on the fork until the loose\nstrands hung clear then lowering it into the mouth, or else using a\ncontinuous lift and sucking into the mouth, helping ourselves to wine\nfrom the grass-covered gallon flask; it swung in a metal cradle and you\npulled the neck of the flask down with the forefinger and the wine,\nclear red, tannic and lovely, poured out into the glass held with the\nsame hand; after this course, the captain commenced picking on the\npriest.\n\nThe priest was young and blushed easily and wore a uniform like the rest\nof us but with a cross in dark red velvet above the left breast pocket\nof his gray tunic. The captain spoke pidgin Italian for my doubtful\nbenefit, in order that I might understand perfectly, that nothing should\nbe lost."}
{"text": "“Priest to-day with girls,” the captain said looking at the priest and\nat me. The priest smiled and blushed and shook his head. This captain\nbaited him often.\n\n“Not true?” asked the captain. “To-day I see priest with girls.”\n\n“No,” said the priest. The other officers were amused at the baiting.\n\n“Priest not with girls,” went on the captain. “Priest never with girls,”\nhe explained to me. He took my glass and filled it, looking at my eyes\nall the time, but not losing sight of the priest.\n\n“Priest every night five against one.” Every one at the table laughed.\n“You understand? Priest every night five against one.” He made a gesture\nand laughed loudly. The priest accepted it as a joke.\n\n“The Pope wants the Austrians to win the war,” the major said. “He loves\nFranz Joseph. That’s where the money comes from. I am an atheist.”\n\n“Did you ever read the ‘Black Pig’?” asked the lieutenant. “I will get\nyou a copy. It was that which shook my faith.”\n\n“It is a filthy and vile book,” said the priest. “You do not really like\nit.”\n\n“It is very valuable,” said the lieutenant. “It tells you about those\npriests. You will like it,” he said to me. I smiled at the priest and he\nsmiled back across the candle-light. “Don’t you read it,” he said.\n\n“I will get it for you,” said the lieutenant.\n\n“All thinking men are atheists,” the major said. “I do not believe in\nthe Free Masons however.”\n\n“I believe in the Free Masons,” the lieutenant said. “It is a noble\norganization.” Some one came in and as the door opened I could see the\nsnow falling.\n\n“There will be no more offensive now that the snow has come,” I said.\n\n“Certainly not,” said the major. “You should go on leave. You should go\nto Rome, Naples, Sicily——”\n\n“He should visit Amalfi,” said the lieutenant “I will write you cards to\nmy family in Amalfi. They will love you like a son.”\n\n“He should go to Palermo.”\n\n“He ought to go to Capri.”\n\n“I would like you to see Abruzzi and visit my family at Capracotta,”\nsaid the priest.\n\n“Listen to him talk about the Abruzzi. There’s more snow there than\nhere. He doesn’t want to see peasants. Let him go to centres of culture\nand civilization.”\n\n“He should have fine girls. I will give you the addresses of places in\nNaples. Beautiful young girls—accompanied by their mothers. Ha! Ha!\nHa!” The captain spread his hand open, the thumb up and fingers\noutspread as when you make shadow pictures. There was a shadow from his\nhand on the wall. He spoke again in pidgin Italian. “You go away like\nthis,” he pointed to the thumb, “and come back like this,” he touched\nthe little finger. Every one laughed.\n\n“Look,” said the captain. He spread the hand again. Again the\ncandle-light made its shadows on the wall. He started with the upright\nthumb and named in their order the thumb and four fingers, “soto-tenente\n(the thumb), tenente (first finger), capitano (next finger), maggiore\n(next to the little finger), and tenente-colonello (the little finger).\nYou go away soto-tenente! You come back soto-colonello!” They all\nlaughed. The captain was having a great success with finger games. He\nlooked at the priest and shouted, “Every night priest five against one!”\nThey all laughed again.\n\n“You must go on leave at once,” the major said.\n\n“I would like to go with you and show you things,” the lieutenant said.\n\n“When you come back bring a phonograph.”\n\n“Bring good opera disks.”\n\n“Bring Caruso.”\n\n“Don’t bring Caruso. He bellows.”\n\n“Don’t you wish you could bellow like him?”\n\n“He bellows. I say he bellows!”\n\n“I would like you to go to Abruzzi,” the priest said. The others were\nshouting. “There is good hunting. You would like the people and though\nit is cold it is clear and dry. You could stay with my family. My father\nis a famous hunter.”\n\n“Come on,” said the captain. “We go whorehouse before it shuts.”\n\n“Good-night,” I said to the priest.\n\n“Good-night,” he said."}
{"text": "When I came back to the front we still lived in that town. There were\nmany more guns in the country around and the spring had come. The fields\nwere green and there were small green shoots on the vines, the trees\nalong the road had small leaves and a breeze came from the sea. I saw\nthe town with the hill and the old castle above it in a cup in the hills\nwith the mountains beyond, brown mountains with a little green on their\nslopes. In the town there were more guns, there were some new hospitals,\nyou met British men and sometimes women, on the street, and a few more\nhouses had been hit by shell fire. It was warm and like the spring and I\nwalked down the alleyway of trees, warmed from the sun on the wall, and\nfound we still lived in the same house and that it all looked the same\nas when I had left it. The door was open, there was a soldier sitting on\na bench outside in the sun, an ambulance was waiting by the side door\nand inside the door, as I went in, there was the smell of marble floors\nand hospital. It was all as I had left it except that now it was spring.\nI looked in the door of the big room and saw the major sitting at his\ndesk, the window open and the sunlight coming into the room. He did not\nsee me and I did not know whether to go in and report or go upstairs\nfirst and clean up. I decided to go on upstairs.\n\nThe room I shared with the lieutenant Rinaldi looked out on the\ncourtyard. The window was open, my bed was made up with blankets and my\nthings hung on the wall, the gas mask in an oblong tin can, the steel\nhelmet on the same peg. At the foot of the bed was my flat trunk, and my\nwinter boots, the leather shiny with oil, were on the trunk. My Austrian\nsniper’s rifle with its blued octagon barrel and the lovely dark walnut,\ncheek-fitted, _schutzen_ stock, hung over the two beds. The telescope\nthat fitted it was, I remembered, locked in the trunk. The lieutenant,\nRinaldi, lay asleep on the other bed. He woke when he heard me in the\nroom and sat up.\n\n“Ciaou!” he said. “What kind of time did you have?”\n\n“Magnificent.”\n\nWe shook hands and he put his arm around my neck and kissed me.\n\n“Oughf,” I said.\n\n“You’re dirty,” he said. “You ought to wash. Where did you go and what\ndid you do? Tell me everything at once.”\n\n“I went everywhere. Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples, Villa San Giovanni,\nMessina, Taormina——”\n\n“You talk like a time-table. Did you have any beautiful adventures?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Milano, Firenze, Roma, Napoli——”\n\n“That’s enough. Tell me really what was the best.”\n\n“In Milano.”\n\n“That was because it was first. Where did you meet her? In the Cova?\nWhere did you go? How did you feel? Tell me everything at once. Did you\nstay all night?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“That’s nothing. Here now we have beautiful girls. New girls never been\nto the front before.”\n\n“Wonderful.”\n\n“You don’t believe me? We will go now this afternoon and see. And in the\ntown we have beautiful English girls. I am now in love with Miss\nBarkley. I will take you to call. I will probably marry Miss Barkley.”\n\n“I have to get washed and report. Doesn’t anybody work now?”\n\n“Since you are gone we have nothing but frostbites, chilblains,\njaundice, gonorrhea, self-inflicted wounds, pneumonia and hard and soft\nchancres. Every week some one gets wounded by rock fragments. There are\na few real wounded. Next week the war starts again. Perhaps it starts\nagain. They say so. Do you think I would do right to marry Miss\nBarkley—after the war of course?”\n\n“Absolutely,” I said and poured the basin full of water.\n\n“To-night you will tell me everything,” said Rinaldi. “Now I must go\nback to sleep to be fresh and beautiful for Miss Barkley.”\n\nI took off my tunic and shirt and washed in the cold water in the basin.\nWhile I rubbed myself with a towel I looked around the room and out the\nwindow and at Rinaldi lying with his eyes closed on the bed. He was\ngood-looking, was my age, and he came from Amalfi. He loved being a\nsurgeon and we were great friends. While I was looking at him he opened\nhis eyes.\n\n“Have you any money?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Loan me fifty lire.”"}
{"text": "I dried my hands and took out my pocket-book from the inside of my tunic\nhanging on the wall. Rinaldi took the note, folded it without rising\nfrom the bed and slid it in his breeches pocket. He smiled, “I must make\non Miss Barkley the impression of a man of sufficient wealth. You are my\ngreat and good friend and financial protector.”\n\n“Go to hell,” I said.\n\nThat night at the mess I sat next to the priest and he was disappointed\nand suddenly hurt that I had not gone to the Abruzzi. He had written to\nhis father that I was coming and they had made preparations. I myself\nfelt as badly as he did and could not understand why I had not gone. It\nwas what I had wanted to do and I tried to explain how one thing had led\nto another and finally he saw it and understood that I had really wanted\nto go and it was almost all right. I had drunk much wine and afterward\ncoffee and Strega and I explained, winefully, how we did not do the\nthings we wanted to do; we never did such things.\n\nWe two were talking while the others argued. I had wanted to go to\nAbruzzi. I had gone to no place where the roads were frozen and hard as\niron, where it was clear cold and dry and the snow was dry and powdery\nand hare-tracks in the snow and the peasants took off their hats and\ncalled you Lord and there was good hunting. I had gone to no such place\nbut to the smoke of cafés and nights when the room whirled and you\nneeded to look at the wall to make it stop, nights in bed, drunk, when\nyou knew that that was all there was, and the strange excitement of\nwaking and not knowing who it was with you, and the world all unreal in\nthe dark and so exciting that you must resume again unknowing and not\ncaring in the night, sure that this was all and all and all and not\ncaring. Suddenly to care very much and to sleep to wake with it\nsometimes morning and all that had been there gone and everything sharp\nand hard and clear and sometimes a dispute about the cost. Sometimes\nstill pleasant and fond and warm and breakfast and lunch. Sometimes all\nniceness gone and glad to get out on the street but always another day\nstarting and then another night. I tried to tell about the night and the\ndifference between the night and the day and how the night was better\nunless the day was very clean and cold and I could not tell it; as I\ncannot tell it now. But if you have had it you know. He had not had it\nbut he understood that I had really wanted to go to the Abruzzi but had\nnot gone and we were still friends, with many tastes alike, but with the\ndifference between us. He had always known what I did not know and what,\nwhen I learned it, I was always able to forget. But I did not know that\nthen, although I learned it later. In the meantime we were all at the\nmess, the meal was finished, and the argument went on. We two stopped\ntalking and the captain shouted, “Priest not happy. Priest not happy\nwithout girls.”\n\n“I am happy,” said the priest.\n\n“Priest not happy. Priest wants Austrians to win the war,” the captain\nsaid. The others listened. The priest shook his head.\n\n“No,” he said.\n\n“Priest wants us never to attack. Don’t you want us never to attack?”\n\n“No. If there is a war I suppose we must attack.”\n\n“Must attack. Shall attack!”\n\nThe priest nodded.\n\n“Leave him alone,” the major said. “He’s all right.”\n\n“He can’t do anything about it anyway,” the captain said. We all got up\nand left the table.\n\nThe battery in the next garden woke me in the morning and I saw the sun\ncoming through the window and got out of the bed. I went to the window\nand looked out. The gravel paths were moist and the grass was wet with\ndew. The battery fired twice and the air came each time like a blow and\nshook the window and made the front of my pajamas flap. I could not see\nthe guns but they were evidently firing directly over us. It was a\nnuisance to have them there but it was a comfort that they were no\nbigger. As I looked out at the garden I heard a motor truck starting on\nthe road. I dressed, went downstairs, had some coffee in the kitchen and\nwent out to the garage."}
{"text": "Ten cars were lined up side by side under the long shed. They were\ntop-heavy, blunt-nosed ambulances, painted gray and built like\nmoving-vans. The mechanics were working on one out in the yard. Three\nothers were up in the mountains at dressing stations.\n\n“Do they ever shell that battery?” I asked one of the mechanics.\n\n“No, Signor Tenente. It is protected by the little hill.”\n\n“How’s everything?”\n\n“Not so bad. This machine is no good but the others march.” He stopped\nworking and smiled. “Were you on permission?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe wiped his hands on his jumper and grinned. “You have a good time?”\nThe others all grinned too.\n\n“Fine,” I said. “What’s the matter with this machine?”\n\n“It’s no good. One thing after another.”\n\n“What’s the matter now?”\n\n“New rings.”\n\nI left them working, the car looking disgraced and empty with the engine\nopen and parts spread on the work bench, and went in under the shed and\nlooked at each of the cars. They were moderately clean, a few freshly\nwashed, the others dusty. I looked at the tires carefully, looking for\ncuts or stone bruises. Everything seemed in good condition. It evidently\nmade no difference whether I was there to look after things or not. I\nhad imagined that the condition of the cars, whether or not things were\nobtainable, the smooth functioning of the business of removing wounded\nand sick from the dressing stations, hauling them back from the\nmountains to the clearing station and then distributing them to the\nhospitals named on their papers, depended to a considerable extent on\nmyself. Evidently it did not matter whether I was there or not.\n\n“Has there been any trouble getting parts?” I asked the sergeant\nmechanic.\n\n“No, Signor Tenente.”\n\n“Where is the gasoline park now?”\n\n“At the same place.”\n\n“Good,” I said and went back to the house and drank another bowl of\ncoffee at the mess table. The coffee was a pale gray and sweet with\ncondensed milk. Outside the window it was a lovely spring morning. There\nwas that beginning of a feeling of dryness in the nose that meant the\nday would be hot later on. That day I visited the posts in the mountains\nand was back in town late in the afternoon.\n\nThe whole thing seemed to run better while I was away. The offensive was\ngoing to start again I heard. The division for which we worked were to\nattack at a place up the river and the major told me that I would see\nabout the posts for during the attack. The attack would cross the river\nup above the narrow gorge and spread up the hillside. The posts for the\ncars would have to be as near the river as they could get and keep\ncovered. They would, of course, be selected by the infantry but we were\nsupposed to work it out. It was one of those things that gave you a\nfalse feeling of soldiering.\n\nI was very dusty and dirty and went up to my room to wash. Rinaldi was\nsitting on the bed with a copy of Hugo’s English grammar. He was\ndressed, wore his black boots, and his hair shone.\n\n“Splendid,” he said when he saw me. “You will come with me to see Miss\nBarkley.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Yes. You will please come and make me a good impression on her.”\n\n“All right. Wait till I get cleaned up.”\n\n“Wash up and come as you are.”\n\nI washed, brushed my hair and we started.\n\n“Wait a minute,” Rinaldi said. “Perhaps we should have a drink.” He\nopened his trunk and took out a bottle.\n\n“Not Strega,” I said.\n\n“No. Grappa.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nHe poured two glasses and we touched them, first fingers extended. The\ngrappa was very strong.\n\n“Another?”\n\n“All right,” I said. We drank the second grappa, Rinaldi put away the\nbottle and we went down the stairs. It was hot walking through the town\nbut the sun was starting to go down and it was very pleasant. The\nBritish hospital was a big villa built by Germans before the war. Miss\nBarkley was in the garden. Another nurse was with her. We saw their\nwhite uniforms through the trees and walked toward them. Rinaldi\nsaluted. I saluted too but more moderately.\n\n“How do you do?” Miss Barkley said. “You’re not an Italian, are you?”\n\n“Oh, no.”\n\nRinaldi was talking with the other nurse. They were laughing.\n\n“What an odd thing—to be in the Italian army.”\n\n“It’s not really the army. It’s only the ambulance.”"}
{"text": "“It’s very odd though. Why did you do it?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I said. “There isn’t always an explanation for\neverything.”\n\n“Oh, isn’t there? I was brought up to think there was.”\n\n“That’s awfully nice.”\n\n“_Do_ we have to go on and talk this way?”\n\n“No,” I said.\n\n“That’s a relief. Isn’t it?”\n\n“What is the stick?” I asked. Miss Barkley was quite tall. She wore what\nseemed to me to be a nurse’s uniform, was blonde and had a tawny skin\nand gray eyes. I thought she was very beautiful. She was carrying a thin\nrattan stick like a toy riding-crop, bound in leather.\n\n“It belonged to a boy who was killed last year.”\n\n“I’m awfully sorry.”\n\n“He was a very nice boy. He was going to marry me and he was killed in\nthe Somme.”\n\n“It was a ghastly show.”\n\n“Were you there?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I’ve heard about it,” she said. “There’s not really any war of that\nsort down here. They sent me the little stick. His mother sent it to me.\nThey returned it with his things.”\n\n“Had you been engaged long?”\n\n“Eight years. We grew up together.”\n\n“And why didn’t you marry?”\n\n“I don’t know,” she said. “I was a fool not to. I could have given him\nthat anyway. But I thought it would be bad for him.”\n\n“I see.”\n\n“Have you ever loved any one?”\n\n“No,” I said.\n\nWe sat down on a bench and I looked at her.\n\n“You have beautiful hair,” I said.\n\n“Do you like it?”\n\n“Very much.”\n\n“I was going to cut it all off when he died.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I wanted to do something for him. You see I didn’t care about the other\nthing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted\nif I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all\nabout it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn’t know.”\n\nI did not say anything.\n\n“I didn’t know about anything then. I thought it would be worse for him.\nI thought perhaps he couldn’t stand it and then of course he was killed\nand that was the end of it.”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Oh, yes,” she said. “That’s the end of it.”\n\nWe looked at Rinaldi talking with the other nurse.\n\n“What is her name?”\n\n“Ferguson. Helen Ferguson. Your friend is a doctor, isn’t he?”\n\n“Yes. He’s very good.”\n\n“That’s splendid. You rarely find any one any good this close to the\nfront. This is close to the front, isn’t it?”\n\n“Quite.”\n\n“It’s a silly front,” she said. “But it’s very beautiful. Are they going\nto have an offensive?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then we’ll have to work. There’s no work now.”\n\n“Have you done nursing long?”\n\n“Since the end of ’fifteen. I started when he did. I remember having a\nsilly idea he might come to the hospital where I was. With a sabre cut,\nI suppose, and a bandage around his head. Or shot through the shoulder.\nSomething picturesque.”\n\n“This is the picturesque front,” I said.\n\n“Yes,” she said. “People can’t realize what France is like. If they did,\nit couldn’t all go on. He didn’t have a sabre cut. They blew him all to\nbits.”\n\nI didn’t say anything.\n\n“Do you suppose it will always go on?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“What’s to stop it?”\n\n“It will crack somewhere.”\n\n“We’ll crack. We’ll crack in France. They can’t go on doing things like\nthe Somme and not crack.”\n\n“They won’t crack here,” I said.\n\n“You think not?”\n\n“No. They did very well last summer.”\n\n“They may crack,” she said. “Anybody may crack.”\n\n“The Germans too.”\n\n“No,” she said. “I think not.”\n\nWe went over toward Rinaldi and Miss Ferguson.\n\n“You love Italy?” Rinaldi asked Miss Ferguson in English.\n\n“Quite well.”\n\n“No understand,” Rinaldi shook his head.\n\n“Abbastanza bene,” I translated. He shook his head.\n\n“That is not good. You love England?”\n\n“Not too well. I’m Scotch, you see.”\n\nRinaldi looked at me blankly.\n\n“She’s Scotch, so she loves Scotland better than England,” I said in\nItalian.\n\n“But Scotland is England.”\n\nI translated this for Miss Ferguson.\n\n“Pas encore,” said Miss Ferguson.\n\n“Not really?”\n\n“Never. We do not like the English.”\n\n“Not like the English? Not like Miss Barkley?”\n\n“Oh, that’s different. You mustn’t take everything so literally.”\n\nAfter a while we said good-night and left. Walking home Rinaldi said,\n“Miss Barkley prefers you to me. That is very clear. But the little\nScotch one is very nice.”\n\n“Very,” I said. I had not noticed her. “You like her?”\n\n“No,” said Rinaldi."}
{"text": "The next afternoon I went to call on Miss Barkley again. She was not in\nthe garden and I went to the side door of the villa where the ambulances\ndrove up. Inside I saw the head nurse, who said Miss Barkley was on\nduty—“there’s a war on, you know.”\n\nI said I knew.\n\n“You’re the American in the Italian army?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, ma’am.”\n\n“How did you happen to do that? Why didn’t you join up with us?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I said. “Could I join now?”\n\n“I’m afraid not now. Tell me. Why did you join up with the Italians?”\n\n“I was in Italy,” I said, “and I spoke Italian.”\n\n“Oh,” she said. “I’m learning it. It’s a beautiful language.”\n\n“Somebody said you should be able to learn it in two weeks.”\n\n“Oh, I’ll not learn it in two weeks. I’ve studied it for months now. You\nmay come and see her after seven o’clock if you wish. She’ll be off\nthen. But don’t bring a lot of Italians.”\n\n“Not even for the beautiful language?”\n\n“No. Nor for the beautiful uniforms.”\n\n“Good-evening,” I said.\n\n“A rivederci, Tenente.”\n\n“A rivederla.” I saluted and went out. It was impossible to salute\nforeigners as an Italian, without embarrassment. The Italian salute\nnever seemed made for export.\n\nThe day had been hot. I had been up the river to the bridgehead at\nPlava. It was there that the offensive was to begin. It had been\nimpossible to advance on the far side the year before because there was\nonly one road leading down from the pass to the pontoon bridge and it\nwas under machine-gun and shell fire for nearly a mile. It was not wide\nenough either to carry all the transport for an offensive and the\nAustrians could make a shambles out of it. But the Italians had crossed\nand spread out a little way on the far side to hold about a mile and a\nhalf on the Austrian side of the river. It was a nasty place and the\nAustrians should not have let them hold it. I suppose it was mutual\ntolerance because the Austrians still kept a bridgehead further down the\nriver. The Austrian trenches were above on the hillside only a few yards\nfrom the Italian lines. There had been a little town but it was all\nrubble. There was what was left of a railway station and a smashed\npermanent bridge that could not be repaired and used because it was in\nplain sight.\n\nI went along the narrow road down toward the river, left the car at the\ndressing station under the hill, crossed the pontoon bridge, which was\nprotected by a shoulder of the mountain, and went through the trenches\nin the smashed-down town and along the edge of the slope. Everybody was\nin the dugouts. There were racks of rockets standing to be touched off\nto call for help from the artillery or to signal with if the telephone\nwires were cut. It was quiet, hot and dirty. I looked across the wire at\nthe Austrian lines. Nobody was in sight. I had a drink with a captain\nthat I knew in one of the dugouts and went back across the bridge."}
{"text": "A new wide road was being finished that would go over the mountain and\nzig-zag down to the bridge. When this road was finished the offensive\nwould start. It came down through the forest in sharp turns. The system\nwas to bring everything down the new road and take the empty trucks,\ncarts and loaded ambulances and all returning traffic up the old narrow\nroad. The dressing station was on the Austrian side of the river under\nthe edge of the hill and stretcher-bearers would bring the wounded back\nacross the pontoon bridge. It would be the same when the offensive\nstarted. As far as I could make out the last mile or so of the new road\nwhere it started to level out would be able to be shelled steadily by\nthe Austrians. It looked as though it might be a mess. But I found a\nplace where the cars would be sheltered after they had passed that last\nbad-looking bit and could wait for the wounded to be brought across the\npontoon bridge. I would have liked to drive over the new road but it was\nnot yet finished. It looked wide and well made with a good grade and the\nturns looked very impressive where you could see them through openings\nin the forest on the mountain side. The cars would be all right with\ntheir good metal-to-metal brakes and anyway, coming down, they would not\nbe loaded. I drove back up the narrow road.\n\nTwo carabinieri held the car up. A shell had fallen and while we waited\nthree others fell up the road. They were seventy-sevens and came with a\nwhishing rush of air, a hard bright burst and flash and then gray smoke\nthat blew across the road. The carabinieri waved us to go on. Passing\nwhere the shells had landed I avoided the small broken places and\nsmelled the high explosive and the smell of blasted clay and stone and\nfreshly shattered flint. I drove back to Gorizia and our villa and, as I\nsaid, went to call on Miss Barkley, who was on duty.\n\nAt dinner I ate very quickly and left for the villa where the British\nhad their hospital. It was really very large and beautiful and there\nwere fine trees in the grounds. Miss Barkley was sitting on a bench in\nthe garden. Miss Ferguson was with her. They seemed glad to see me and\nin a little while Miss Ferguson excused herself and went away.\n\n“I’ll leave you two,” she said. “You get along very well without me.”\n\n“Don’t go, Helen,” Miss Barkley said.\n\n“I’d really rather. I must write some letters.”\n\n“Good-night,” I said.\n\n“Good-night, Mr. Henry.”\n\n“Don’t write anything that will bother the censor.”\n\n“Don’t worry. I only write about what a beautiful place we live in and\nhow brave the Italians are.”\n\n“That way you’ll be decorated.”\n\n“That will be nice. Good-night, Catherine.”\n\n“I’ll see you in a little while,” Miss Barkley said. Miss Ferguson\nwalked away in the dark.\n\n“She’s nice,” I said.\n\n“Oh, yes, she’s very nice. She’s a nurse.”\n\n“Aren’t you a nurse?”\n\n“Oh, no. I’m something called a V. A. D. We work very hard but no one\ntrusts us.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“They don’t trust us when there’s nothing going on. When there is really\nwork they trust us.”\n\n“What is the difference?”\n\n“A nurse is like a doctor. It takes a long time to be. A V. A. D. is a\nshort cut.”\n\n“I see.”\n\n“The Italians didn’t want women so near the front. So we’re all on very\nspecial behavior. We don’t go out.”\n\n“I can come here though.”\n\n“Oh, yes. We’re not cloistered.”\n\n“Let’s drop the war.”\n\n“It’s very hard. There’s no place to drop it.”\n\n“Let’s drop it anyway.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nWe looked at each other in the dark. I thought she was very beautiful\nand I took her hand. She let me take it and I held it and put my arm\naround under her arm.\n\n“No,” she said. I kept my arm where it was.\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “Please.” I leaned forward in the dark to kiss her and\nthere was a sharp stinging flash. She had slapped my face hard. Her hand\nhad hit my nose and eyes, and tears came in my eyes from the reflex.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” she said. I felt I had a certain advantage.\n\n“You were quite right.”\n\n“I’m dreadfully sorry,” she said. “I just couldn’t stand the\nnurse’s-evening-off aspect of it. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I did hurt\nyou, didn’t I?”\n\nShe was looking at me in the dark. I was angry and yet certain, seeing\nit all ahead like the moves in a chess game."}
{"text": "“You did exactly right,” I said. “I don’t mind at all.”\n\n“Poor man.”\n\n“You see I’ve been leading a sort of a funny life. And I never even talk\nEnglish. And then you are so very beautiful.” I looked at her.\n\n“You don’t need to say a lot of nonsense. I said I was sorry. We do get\nalong.”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “And we have gotten away from the war.”\n\nShe laughed. It was the first time I had ever heard her laugh. I watched\nher face.\n\n“You are sweet,” she said.\n\n“No, I’m not.”\n\n“Yes. You are a dear. I’d be glad to kiss you if you don’t mind.”\n\nI looked in her eyes and put my arm around her as I had before and\nkissed her. I kissed her hard and held her tight and tried to open her\nlips; they were closed tight. I was still angry and as I held her\nsuddenly she shivered. I held her close against me and could feel her\nheart beating and her lips opened and her head went back against my hand\nand then she was crying on my shoulder.\n\n“Oh, darling,” she said. “You will be good to me, won’t you?”\n\nWhat the hell, I thought. I stroked her hair and patted her shoulder.\nShe was crying.\n\n“You will, won’t you?” She looked up at me. “Because we’re going to have\na strange life.”\n\nAfter a while I walked with her to the door of the villa and she went in\nand I walked home. Back at the villa I went upstairs to the room.\nRinaldi was lying on his bed. He looked at me.\n\n“So you make progress with Miss Barkley?”\n\n“We are friends.”\n\n“You have that pleasant air of a dog in heat.”\n\nI did not understand the word.\n\n“Of a what?”\n\nHe explained.\n\n“You,” I said, “have that pleasant air of a dog who—”\n\n“Stop it,” he said. “In a little while we would say insulting things.”\nHe laughed.\n\n“Good-night,” I said.\n\n“Good-night, little puppy.”\n\nI knocked over his candle with the pillow and got into bed in the dark.\n\nRinaldi picked up the candle, lit it and went on reading.\n\nI was away for two days at the posts. When I got home it was too late\nand I did not see Miss Barkley until the next evening. She was not in\nthe garden and I had to wait in the office of the hospital until she\ncame down. There were many marble busts on painted wooden pillars along\nthe walls of the room they used for an office. The hall too, that the\noffice opened on, was lined with them. They had the complete marble\nquality of all looking alike. Sculpture had always seemed a dull\nbusiness—still, bronzes looked like something. But marble busts all\nlooked like a cemetery. There was one fine cemetery though—the one at\nPisa. Genoa was the place to see the bad marbles. This had been the\nvilla of a very wealthy German and the busts must have cost him plenty.\nI wondered who had done them and how much he got. I tried to make out\nwhether they were members of the family or what; but they were all\nuniformly classical. You could not tell anything about them."}
{"text": "I sat on a chair and held my cap. We were supposed to wear steel helmets\neven in Gorizia but they were uncomfortable and too bloody theatrical in\na town where the civilian inhabitants had not been evacuated. I wore one\nwhen we went up to the posts and carried an English gas mask. We were\njust beginning to get some of them. They were a real mask. Also we were\nrequired to wear an automatic pistol; even doctors and sanitary\nofficers. I felt it against the back of the chair. You were liable to\narrest if you did not have one worn in plain sight. Rinaldi carried a\nholster stuffed with toilet paper. I wore a real one and felt like a\ngunman until I practised firing it. It was an Astra 7.65 caliber with a\nshort barrel and it jumped so sharply when you let it off that there was\nno question of hitting anything. I practised with it, holding below the\ntarget and trying to master the jerk of the ridiculous short barrel\nuntil I could hit within a yard of where I aimed at twenty paces and\nthen the ridiculousness of carrying a pistol at all came over me and I\nsoon forgot it and carried it flopping against the small of my back with\nno feeling at all except a vague sort of shame when I met\nEnglish-speaking people. I sat now in the chair and an orderly of some\nsort looked at me disapprovingly from behind a desk while I looked at\nthe marble floor, the pillars with the marble busts, and the frescoes on\nthe wall and waited for Miss Barkley. The frescoes were not bad. Any\nfrescoes were good when they started to peel and flake off.\n\nI saw Catherine Barkley coming down the hall, and stood up. She did not\nseem tall walking toward me but she looked very lovely.\n\n“Good-evening, Mr. Henry,” she said.\n\n“How do you do?” I said. The orderly was listening behind the desk.\n\n“Shall we sit here or go out in the garden?”\n\n“Let’s go out. It’s much cooler.”\n\nI walked behind her out into the garden, the orderly looking after us.\nWhen we were out on the gravel drive she said, “Where have you been?”\n\n“I’ve been out on post.”\n\n“You couldn’t have sent me a note?”\n\n“No,” I said. “Not very well. I thought I was coming back.”\n\n“You ought to have let me know, darling.”\n\nWe were off the driveway, walking under the trees. I took her hands,\nthen stopped and kissed her.\n\n“Isn’t there anywhere we can go?”\n\n“No,” she said. “We have to just walk here. You’ve been away a long\ntime.”\n\n“This is the third day. But I’m back now.”\n\nShe looked at me, “And you do love me?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You did say you loved me, didn’t you?”\n\n“Yes,” I lied. “I love you.” I had not said it before.\n\n“And you call me Catherine?”\n\n“Catherine.” We walked on a way and were stopped under a tree.\n\n“Say, ‘I’ve come back to Catherine in the night.’”\n\n“I’ve come back to Catherine in the night.”\n\n“Oh, darling, you have come back, haven’t you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I love you so and it’s been awful. You won’t go away?”\n\n“No. I’ll always come back.”\n\n“Oh, I love you so. Please put your hand there again.”\n\n“It’s not been away.” I turned her so I could see her face when I kissed\nher and I saw that her eyes were shut. I kissed both her shut eyes. I\nthought she was probably a little crazy. It was all right if she was. I\ndid not care what I was getting into. This was better than going every\nevening to the house for officers where the girls climbed all over you\nand put your cap on backward as a sign of affection between their trips\nupstairs with brother officers. I knew I did not love Catherine Barkley\nnor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which\nyou said things instead of playing cards. Like bridge you had to pretend\nyou were playing for money or playing for some stakes. Nobody had\nmentioned what the stakes were. It was all right with me.\n\n“I wish there was some place we could go,” I said. I was experiencing\nthe masculine difficulty of making love very long standing up.\n\n“There isn’t any place,” she said. She came back from wherever she had\nbeen.\n\n“We might sit there just for a little while.”\n\nWe sat on the flat stone bench and I held Catherine Barkley’s hand. She\nwould not let me put my arm around her.\n\n“Are you very tired?” she asked.\n\n“No.”\n\nShe looked down at the grass.\n\n“This is a rotten game we play, isn’t it?”\n\n“What game?”"}
{"text": "“Don’t be dull.”\n\n“I’m not, on purpose.”\n\n“You’re a nice boy,” she said. “And you play it as well as you know how.\nBut it’s a rotten game.”\n\n“Do you always know what people think?”\n\n“Not always. But I do with you. You don’t have to pretend you love me.\nThat’s over for the evening. Is there anything you’d like to talk\nabout?”\n\n“But I do love you.”\n\n“Please let’s not lie when we don’t have to. I had a very fine little\nshow and I’m all right now. You see I’m not mad and I’m not gone off.\nIt’s only a little sometimes.”\n\nI pressed her hand, “Dear Catherine.”\n\n“It sounds very funny now—Catherine. You don’t pronounce it very much\nalike. But you’re very nice. You’re a very good boy.”\n\n“That’s what the priest said.”\n\n“Yes, you’re very good. And you will come and see me?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“And you don’t have to say you love me. That’s all over for a while.”\nShe stood up and put out her hand. “Good-night.”\n\nI wanted to kiss her.\n\n“No,” she said. “I’m awfully tired.”\n\n“Kiss me, though,” I said.\n\n“I’m awfully tired, darling.”\n\n“Kiss me.”\n\n“Do you want to very much?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWe kissed and she broke away suddenly. “No. Good-night, please,\ndarling.” We walked to the door and I saw her go in and down the hall. I\nliked to watch her move. She went on down the hall. I went on home. It\nwas a hot night and there was a good deal going on up in the mountains.\nI watched the flashes on San Gabriele.\n\nI stopped in front of the Villa Rossa. The shutters were up but it was\nstill going on inside. Somebody was singing. I went on home. Rinaldi\ncame in while I was undressing.\n\n“Ah, ha!” he said. “It does not go so well. Baby is puzzled.”\n\n“Where have you been?”\n\n“At the Villa Rossa. It was very edifying, baby. We all sang. Where have\nyou been?”\n\n“Calling on the British.”\n\n“Thank God I did not become involved with the British.”\n\nI came back the next afternoon from our first mountain post and stopped\nthe car at the _smistimento_ where the wounded and sick were sorted by\ntheir papers and the papers marked for the different hospitals. I had\nbeen driving and I sat in the car and the driver took the papers in. It\nwas a hot day and the sky was very bright and blue and the road was\nwhite and dusty. I sat in the high seat of the Fiat and thought about\nnothing. A regiment went by in the road and I watched them pass. The men\nwere hot and sweating. Some wore their steel helmets but most of them\ncarried them slung from their packs. Most of the helmets were too big\nand came down almost over the ears of the men who wore them. The\nofficers all wore helmets; better-fitting helmets. It was half of the\nbrigata Basilicata. I identified them by their red and white striped\ncollar mark. There were stragglers going by long after the regiment had\npassed—men who could not keep up with their platoons. They were sweaty,\ndusty and tired. Some looked pretty bad. A soldier came along after the\nlast of the stragglers. He was walking with a limp. He stopped and sat\ndown beside the road. I got down and went over.\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\nHe looked at me, then stood up.\n\n“I’m going on.”\n\n“What’s the trouble?”\n\n“—— the war.”\n\n“What’s wrong with your leg?”\n\n“It’s not my leg. I got a rupture.”\n\n“Why don’t you ride with the transport?” I asked. “Why don’t you go to\nthe hospital?”\n\n“They won’t let me. The lieutenant said I slipped the truss on purpose.”\n\n“Let me feel it.”\n\n“It’s way out.”\n\n“Which side is it on?”\n\n“Here.”\n\nI felt it.\n\n“Cough,” I said.\n\n“I’m afraid it will make it bigger. It’s twice as big as it was this\nmorning.”\n\n“Sit down,” I said. “As soon as I get the papers on these wounded I’ll\ntake you along the road and drop you with your medical officers.”\n\n“He’ll say I did it on purpose.”\n\n“They can’t do anything,” I said. “It’s not a wound. You’ve had it\nbefore, haven’t you?”\n\n“But I lost the truss.”\n\n“They’ll send you to a hospital.”\n\n“Can’t I stay here, Tenente?”\n\n“No, I haven’t any papers for you.”\n\nThe driver came out of the door with the papers for the wounded in the\ncar.\n\n“Four for 105. Two for 132,” he said. They were hospitals beyond the\nriver.\n\n“You drive,” I said. I helped the soldier with the rupture up on the\nseat with us.\n\n“You speak English?” he asked.\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“How you like this goddam war?”\n\n“Rotten.”\n\n“I say it’s rotten. Jesus Christ, I say it’s rotten.”\n\n“Were you in the States?”"}
{"text": "“Sure. In Pittsburg. I knew you was an American.”\n\n“Don’t I talk Italian good enough?”\n\n“I knew you was an American all right.”\n\n“Another American,” said the driver in Italian looking at the hernia\nman.\n\n“Listen, lootenant. Do you have to take me to that regiment?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Because the captain doctor knew I had this rupture. I threw away the\ngoddam truss so it would get bad and I wouldn’t have to go to the line\nagain.”\n\n“I see.”\n\n“Couldn’t you take me no place else?”\n\n“If it was closer to the front I could take you to a first medical post.\nBut back here you’ve got to have papers.”\n\n“If I go back they’ll make me get operated on and then they’ll put me in\nthe line all the time.”\n\nI thought it over.\n\n“You wouldn’t want to go in the line all the time, would you?” he asked.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Jesus Christ, ain’t this a goddam war?”\n\n“Listen,” I said. “You get out and fall down by the road and get a bump\non your head and I’ll pick you up on our way back and take you to a\nhospital. We’ll stop by the road here, Aldo.” We stopped at the side of\nthe road. I helped him down.\n\n“I’ll be right here, lieutenant,” he said.\n\n“So long,” I said. We went on and passed the regiment about a mile\nahead, then crossed the river, cloudy with snow-water and running fast\nthrough the spiles of the bridge, to ride along the road across the\nplain and deliver the wounded at the two hospitals. I drove coming back\nand went fast with the empty car to find the man from Pittsburg. First\nwe passed the regiment, hotter and slower than ever: then the\nstragglers. Then we saw a horse ambulance stopped by the road. Two men\nwere lifting the hernia man to put him in. They had come back for him.\nHe shook his head at me. His helmet was off and his forehead was\nbleeding below the hair line. His nose was skinned and there was dust on\nthe bloody patch and dust in his hair.\n\n“Look at the bump, lieutenant!” he shouted. “Nothing to do. They come\nback for me.”"}
{"text": "When I got back to the villa it was five o’clock and I went out where we\nwashed the cars, to take a shower. Then I made out my report in my room,\nsitting in my trousers and an undershirt in front of the open window. In\ntwo days the offensive was to start and I would go with the cars to\nPlava. It was a long time since I had written to the States and I knew I\nshould write but I had let it go so long that it was almost impossible\nto write now. There was nothing to write about. I sent a couple of army\nZona di Guerra post-cards, crossing out everything except, I am well. That should handle them. Those post-cards would be very fine in America;\nstrange and mysterious. This was a strange and mysterious war zone but I\nsupposed it was quite well run and grim compared to other wars with the\nAustrians. The Austrian army was created to give Napoleon victories; any\nNapoleon. I wished we had a Napoleon, but instead we had Il Generale\nCadorna, fat and prosperous, and Vittorio Emmanuele, the tiny man with\nthe long thin neck and the goat beard. Over on the right they had the\nDuke of Aosta. Maybe he was too good-looking to be a great general but\nhe looked like a man. Lots of them would have liked him to be king. He\nlooked like a king. He was the King’s uncle and commanded the third\narmy. We were in the second army. There were some British batteries up\nwith the third army. I had met two gunners from that lot, in Milan. They\nwere very nice and we had a big evening. They were big and shy and\nembarrassed and very appreciative together of anything that happened. I\nwish that I was with the British. It would have been much simpler. Still\nI would probably have been killed. Not in this ambulance business. Yes,\neven in the ambulance business. British ambulance drivers were killed\nsometimes. Well, I knew I would not be killed. Not in this war. It did\nnot have anything to do with me. It seemed no more dangerous to me\nmyself than war in the movies. I wished to God it was over though. Maybe\nit would finish this summer. Maybe the Austrians would crack. They had\nalways cracked in other wars. What was the matter with this war? Everybody said the French were through. Rinaldi said that the French had\nmutinied and troops marched on Paris. I asked him what happened and he\nsaid, “Oh, they stopped them.” I wanted to go to Austria without war. I\nwanted to go to the Black Forest. I wanted to go to the Hartz Mountains. Where were the Hartz Mountains anyway? They were fighting in the\nCarpathians. I did not want to go there anyway. It might be good though. I could go to Spain if there was no war. The sun was going down and the\nday was cooling off. After supper I would go and see Catherine Barkley. I wished she were here now. I wished I were in Milan with her. I would\nlike to eat at the Cova and then walk down the Via Manzoni in the hot\nevening and cross over and turn off along the canal and go to the hotel\nwith Catherine Barkley. Maybe she would. Maybe she would pretend that I\nwas her boy that was killed and we would go in the front door and the\nporter would take off his cap and I would stop at the concierge’s desk\nand ask for the key and she would stand by the elevator and then we\nwould get in the elevator and it would go up very slowly clicking at all\nthe floors and then our floor and the boy would open the door and stand\nthere and she would step out and I would step out and we would walk down\nthe hall and I would put the key in the door and open it and go in and\nthen take down the telephone and ask them to send a bottle of capri\nbianca in a silver bucket full of ice and you would hear the ice against\nthe pail coming down the corridor and the boy would knock and I would\nsay leave it outside the door please."}
{"text": "Because we would not wear any\nclothes because it was so hot and the window open and the swallows\nflying over the roofs of the houses and when it was dark afterward and\nyou went to the window very small bats hunting over the houses and close\ndown over the trees and we would drink the capri and the door locked and\nit hot and only a sheet and the whole night and we would both love each\nother all night in the hot night in Milan. That was how it ought to be. I would eat quickly and go and see Catherine Barkley.\n\nThey talked too much at the mess and I drank wine because to-night we\nwere not all brothers unless I drank a little and talked with the priest\nabout Archbishop Ireland who was, it seemed, a noble man and with whose\ninjustice, the injustices he had received and in which I participated as\nan American, and of which I had never heard, I feigned acquaintance. It\nwould have been impolite not to have known something of them when I had\nlistened to such a splendid explanation of their causes which were,\nafter all, it seemed, misunderstandings. I thought he had a fine name\nand he came from Minnesota which made a lovely name: Ireland of\nMinnesota, Ireland of Wisconsin, Ireland of Michigan. What made it\npretty was that it sounded like Island. No that wasn’t it. There was\nmore to it than that. Yes, father. That is true, father. Perhaps,\nfather. No, father. Well, maybe yes, father. You know more about it than\nI do, father. The priest was good but dull. The officers were not good\nbut dull. The King was good but dull. The wine was bad but not dull. It\ntook the enamel off your teeth and left it on the roof of your mouth.\n\n“And the priest was locked up,” Rocca said, “because they found the\nthree per cent bonds on his person. It was in France of course. Here\nthey would never have arrested him. He denied all knowledge of the five\nper cent bonds. This took place at Béziers. I was there and reading of\nit in the paper, went to the jail and asked to see the priest. It was\nquite evident he had stolen the bonds.”\n\n“I don’t believe a word of this,” Rinaldi said.\n\n“Just as you like,” Rocca said. “But I am telling it for our priest\nhere. It is very informative. He is a priest; he will appreciate it.”\n\nThe priest smiled. “Go on,” he said. “I am listening.”\n\n“Of course some of the bonds were not accounted for but the priest had\nall of the three per cent bonds and several local obligations, I forget\nexactly what they were. So I went to the jail, now this is the point of\nthe story, and I stood outside his cell and I said as though I were\ngoing to confession, ‘Bless me, father, for you have sinned.’”\n\nThere was great laughter from everybody."}
{"text": "“And what did he say?” asked the priest. Rocca ignored this and went on\nto explain the joke to me. “You see the point, don’t you?” It seemed it\nwas a very funny joke if you understood it properly. They poured me more\nwine and I told the story about the English private soldier who was\nplaced under the shower bath. Then the major told the story of the\neleven Czecho-slovaks and the Hungarian corporal. After some more wine I\ntold the story of the jockey who found the penny. The major said there\nwas an Italian story something like that about the duchess who could not\nsleep at night. At this point the priest left and I told the story about\nthe travelling salesman who arrived at five o’clock in the morning at\nMarseilles when the mistral was blowing. The major said he had heard a\nreport that I could drink. I denied this. He said it was true and by the\ncorpse of Bacchus we would test whether it was true or not. Not Bacchus,\nI said. Not Bacchus. Yes, Bacchus, he said. I should drink cup for cup\nand glass for glass with Bassi, Fillipo Vincenza. Bassi said no that was\nno test because he had already drunk twice as much as I. I said that was\na foul lie and, Bacchus or no Bacchus, Fillipo Vincenza Bassi or Bassi\nFillippo Vicenza had never touched a drop all evening and what was his\nname anyway? He said was my name Frederico Enrico or Enrico Federico? I\nsaid let the best man win, Bacchus barred, and the major started us with\nred wine in mugs. Half-way through the wine I did not want any more. I\nremembered where I was going.\n\n“Bassi wins,” I said. “He’s a better man than I am. I have to go.”\n\n“He does really,” said Rinaldi. “He has a rendezvous. I know all about\nit.”\n\n“I have to go.”\n\n“Another night,” said Bassi. “Another night when you feel stronger.” He\nslapped me on the shoulder. There were lighted candles on the table. All\nthe officers were very happy. “Good-night, gentlemen,” I said.\n\nRinaldi went out with me. We stood outside the door on the patch and he\nsaid, “You’d better not go up there drunk.”\n\n“I’m not drunk, Rinin. Really.”\n\n“You’d better chew some coffee.”\n\n“Nonsense.”\n\n“I’ll get some, baby. You walk up and down.” He came back with a handful\nof roasted coffee beans. “Chew those, baby, and God be with you.”\n\n“Bacchus,” I said.\n\n“I’ll walk down with you.”\n\n“I’m perfectly all right.”\n\nWe walked along together through the town and I chewed the coffee. At\nthe gate of the driveway that led up to the British villa, Rinaldi said\ngood-night.\n\n“Good-night,” I said. “Why don’t you come in?”\n\nHe shook his head. “No,” he said, “I like the simpler pleasures.”\n\n“Thank you for the coffee beans.”\n\n“Nothing, baby. Nothing.”\n\nI started down the driveway. The outlines of the cypresses that lined it\nwere sharp and clear. I looked back and saw Rinaldi standing watching me\nand waved to him.\n\nI sat in the reception hall of the villa, waiting for Catherine Barkley\nto come down. Some one was coming down the hall-way. I stood up, but it\nwas not Catherine. It was Miss Ferguson.\n\n“Hello,” she said. “Catherine asked me to tell you she was sorry she\ncouldn’t see you this evening.”\n\n“I’m so sorry. I hope she’s not ill.”\n\n“She’s not awfully well.”\n\n“Will you tell her how sorry I am?”\n\n“Yes, I will.”\n\n“Do you think it would be any good to try and see her to-morrow?”\n\n“Yes, I do.”\n\n“Thank you very much,” I said. “Good-night.”\n\nI went out the door and suddenly I felt lonely and empty. I had treated\nseeing Catherine very lightly, I had gotten somewhat drunk and had\nnearly forgotten to come but when I could not see her there I was\nfeeling lonely and hollow.\n\nThe next afternoon we heard there was to be an attack up the river that\nnight and that we were to take four cars there. Nobody knew anything\nabout it although they all spoke with great positiveness and strategical\nknowledge. I was riding in the first car and as we passed the entry to\nthe British hospital I told the driver to stop. The other cars pulled\nup. I got out and told the driver to go on and that if we had not caught\nup to them at the junction of the road to Cormons to wait there. I\nhurried up the driveway and inside the reception hall I asked for Miss\nBarkley.\n\n“She’s on duty.”"}
{"text": "“Could I see her just for a moment?”\n\nThey sent an orderly to see and she came back with him.\n\n“I stopped to ask if you were better. They told me you were on duty, so\nI asked to see you.”\n\n“I’m quite well,” she said, “I think the heat knocked me over\nyesterday.”\n\n“I have to go.”\n\n“I’ll just step out the door a minute.”\n\n“And you’re all right?” I asked outside.\n\n“Yes, darling. Are you coming to-night?”\n\n“No. I’m leaving now for a show up above Plava.”\n\n“A show?”\n\n“I don’t think it’s anything.”\n\n“And you’ll be back?”\n\n“To-morrow.”\n\nShe was unclasping something from her neck. She put it in my hand. “It’s\na Saint Anthony,” she said. “And come to-morrow night.”\n\n“You’re not a Catholic, are you?”\n\n“No. But they say a Saint Anthony’s very useful.”\n\n“I’ll take care of him for you. Good-by.”\n\n“No,” she said, “not good-by.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Be a good boy and be careful. No, you can’t kiss me here. You can’t.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nI looked back and saw her standing on the steps. She waved and I kissed\nmy hand and held it out. She waved again and then I was out of the\ndriveway and climbing up into the seat of the ambulance and we started.\nThe Saint Anthony was in a little white metal capsule. I opened the\ncapsule and spilled him out into my hand.\n\n“Saint Anthony?” asked the driver.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I have one.” His right hand left the wheel and opened a button on his\ntunic and pulled it out from under his shirt.\n\n“See?”\n\nI put my Saint Anthony back in the capsule, spilled the thin gold chain\ntogether and put it all in my breast pocket.\n\n“You don’t wear him?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“It’s better to wear him. That’s what it’s for.”\n\n“All right,” I said. I undid the clasp of the gold chain and put it\naround my neck and clasped it. The saint hung down on the outside of my\nuniform and I undid the throat of my tunic, unbuttoned the shirt collar\nand dropped him in under the shirt. I felt him in his metal box against\nmy chest while we drove. Then I forgot about him. After I was wounded I\nnever found him. Some one probably got it at one of the dressing\nstations.\n\nWe drove fast when we were over the bridge and soon we saw the dust of\nthe other cars ahead down the road. The road curved and we saw the three\ncars looking quite small, the dust rising from the wheels and going off\nthrough the trees. We caught them and passed them and turned off on a\nroad that climbed up into the hills. Driving in convoy is not unpleasant\nif you are the first car and I settled back in the seat and watched the\ncountry. We were in the foot-hills on the near side of the river and as\nthe road mounted there were the high mountains off to the north with\nsnow still on the tops. I looked back and saw the three cars all\nclimbing, spaced by the interval of their dust. We passed a long column\nof loaded mules, the drivers walking along beside the mules wearing red\nfezzes. They were bersaglieri."}
{"text": "Beyond the mule train the road was empty and we climbed through the\nhills and then went down over the shoulder of a long hill into a\nriver-valley. There were trees along both sides of the road and through\nthe right line of trees I saw the river, the water clear, fast and\nshallow. The river was low and there were stretches of sand and pebbles\nwith a narrow channel of water and sometimes the water spread like a\nsheen over the pebbly bed. Close to the bank I saw deep pools, the water\nblue like the sky. I saw arched stone bridges over the river where\ntracks turned off from the road and we passed stone farmhouses with pear\ntrees candelabraed against their south walls and low stone walls in the\nfields. The road went up the valley a long way and then we turned off\nand commenced to climb into the hills again. The road climbed steeply\ngoing up and back and forth through chestnut woods to level finally\nalong a ridge. I could look down through the woods and see, far below,\nwith the sun on it, the line of the river that separated the two armies.\nWe went along the rough new military road that followed the crest of the\nridge and I looked to the north at the two ranges of mountains, green\nand dark to the snow-line and then white and lovely in the sun. Then, as\nthe road mounted along the ridge, I saw a third range of mountains,\nhigher snow mountains, that looked chalky white and furrowed, with\nstrange planes, and then there were mountains far off beyond all these\nthat you could hardly tell if you really saw. Those were all the\nAustrians’ mountains and we had nothing like them. Ahead there was a\nrounded turn-off in the road to the right and looking down I could see\nthe road dropping through the trees. There were troops on this road and\nmotor trucks and mules with mountain guns and as we went down, keeping\nto the side, I could see the river far down below, the line of ties and\nrails running along it, the old bridge where the railway crossed to the\nother side and across, under a hill beyond the river, the broken houses\nof the little town that was to be taken.\n\nIt was nearly dark when we came down and turned onto the main road that\nran beside the river."}
{"text": "The road was crowded and there were screens of corn-stalk and straw\nmatting on both sides and matting over the top so that it was like the\nentrance at a circus or a native village. We drove slowly in this\nmatting-covered tunnel and came out onto a bare cleared space where the\nrailway station had been. The road here was below the level of the river\nbank and all along the side of the sunken road there were holes dug in\nthe bank with infantry in them. The sun was going down and looking up\nalong the bank as we drove I saw the Austrian observation balloons above\nthe hills on the other side dark against the sunset. We parked the cars\nbeyond a brickyard. The ovens and some deep holes had been equipped as\ndressing stations. There were three doctors that I knew. I talked with\nthe major and learned that when it should start and our cars should be\nloaded we would drive them back along the screened road and up to the\nmain road along the ridge where there would be a post and other cars to\nclear them. He hoped the road would not jam. It was a one-road show. The\nroad was screened because it was in sight of the Austrians across the\nriver. Here at the brickyard we were sheltered from rifle or machine-gun\nfire by the river bank. There was one smashed bridge across the river.\nThey were going to put over another bridge when the bombardment started\nand some troops were to cross at the shallows up above at the bend of\nthe river. The major was a little man with upturned mustaches. He had\nbeen in the war in Libya and wore two wound-stripes. He said that if the\nthing went well he would see that I was decorated. I said I hoped it\nwould go well but that he was too kind. I asked him if there was a big\ndugout where the drivers could stay and he sent a soldier to show me. I\nwent with him and found the dugout, which was very good. The drivers\nwere pleased with it and I left them there. The major asked me to have a\ndrink with him and two other officers. We drank rum and it was very\nfriendly. Outside it was getting dark. I asked what time the attack was\nto be and they said as soon as it was dark. I went back to the drivers.\nThey were sitting in the dugout talking and when I came in they stopped.\nI gave them each a package of cigarettes, Macedonias, loosely packed\ncigarettes that spilled tobacco and needed to have the ends twisted\nbefore you smoked them. Manera lit his lighter and passed it around. The\nlighter was shaped like a Fiat radiator. I told them what I had heard.\n\n“Why didn’t we see the post when we came down?” Passini asked.\n\n“It was just beyond where we turned off.”\n\n“That road will be a dirty mess,” Manera said.\n\n“They’ll shell the —— out of us.”\n\n“Probably.”\n\n“What about eating, lieutenant? We won’t get a chance to eat after this\nthing starts.”\n\n“I’ll go and see now,” I said.\n\n“You want us to stay here or can we look around?”\n\n“Better stay here.”\n\nI went back to the major’s dugout and he said the field kitchen would be\nalong and the drivers could come and get their stew. He would loan them\nmess tins if they did not have them. I said I thought they had them. I\nwent back and told the drivers I would get them as soon as the food\ncame. Manera said he hoped it would come before the bombardment started.\nThey were silent until I went out. They were all mechanics and hated the\nwar.\n\nI went out to look at the cars and see what was going on and then came\nback and sat down in the dugout with the four drivers. We sat on the\nground with our backs against the wall and smoked. Outside it was nearly\ndark. The earth of the dugout was warm and dry and I let my shoulders\nback against the wall, sitting on the small of my back, and relaxed.\n\n“Who goes to the attack?” asked Gavuzzi.\n\n“Bersaglieri.”\n\n“All bersaglieri?”\n\n“I think so.”\n\n“There aren’t enough troops here for a real attack.”\n\n“It is probably to draw attention from where the real attack will be.”\n\n“Do the men know that who attack?”\n\n“I don’t think so.”\n\n“Of course they don’t,” Manera said. “They wouldn’t attack if they did.”\n\n“Yes they would,” Passini said. “Bersaglieri are fools.”\n\n“They are brave and have good discipline,” I said."}
{"text": "“They are big through the chest by measurement, and healthy. But they\nare still fools.”\n\n“The granatieri are tall,” Manera said. This was a joke. They all\nlaughed.\n\n“Were you there, Tenente, when they wouldn’t attack and they shot every\ntenth man?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“It is true. They lined them up afterward and took every tenth man.\nCarabinieri shot them.”\n\n“Carabinieri,” said Passini and spat on the floor. “But those\ngrenadiers; all over six feet. They wouldn’t attack.”\n\n“If everybody would not attack the war would be over,” Manera said.\n\n“It wasn’t that way with the granatieri. They were afraid. The officers\nall came from such good families.”\n\n“Some of the officers went alone.”\n\n“A sergeant shot two officers who would not get out.”\n\n“Some troops went out.”\n\n“Those that went out were not lined up when they took the tenth men.”\n\n“One of those shot by the carabinieri is from my town,” Passini said.\n“He was a big smart tall boy to be in the granatieri. Always in Rome.\nAlways with the girls. Always with the carabinieri.” He laughed. “Now\nthey have a guard outside his house with a bayonet and nobody can come\nto see his mother and father and sisters and his father loses his civil\nrights and cannot even vote. They are all without law to protect them.\nAnybody can take their property.”\n\n“If it wasn’t that that happens to their families nobody would go to the\nattack.”\n\n“Yes. Alpini would. These V. E. soldiers would. Some bersaglieri.”\n\n“Bersaglieri have run too. Now they try to forget it.”\n\n“You should not let us talk this way, Tenente. Evviva l’esercito,”\nPassini said sarcastically.\n\n“I know how you talk,” I said. “But as long as you drive the cars and\nbehave——”\n\n“—and don’t talk so other officers can hear,” Manera finished.\n\n“I believe we should get the war over,” I said. “It would not finish it\nif one side stopped fighting. It would only be worse if we stopped\nfighting.”\n\n“It could not be worse,” Passini said respectfully. “There is nothing\nworse than war.”\n\n“Defeat is worse.”\n\n“I do not believe it,” Passini said still respectfully. “What is defeat?\nYou go home.”\n\n“They come after you. They take your home. They take your sisters.”\n\n“I don’t believe it,” Passini said. “They can’t do that to everybody.\nLet everybody defend his home. Let them keep their sisters in the\nhouse.”\n\n“They hang you. They come and make you be a soldier again. Not in the\nauto-ambulance, in the infantry.”\n\n“They can’t hang every one.”\n\n“An outside nation can’t make you be a soldier,” Manera said. “At the\nfirst battle you all run.”\n\n“Like the Tchecos.”\n\n“I think you do not know anything about being conquered and so you think\nit is not bad.”\n\n“Tenente,” Passini said. “We understand you let us talk. Listen. There\nis nothing as bad as war. We in the auto-ambulance cannot even realize\nat all how bad it is. When people realize how bad it is they cannot do\nanything to stop it because they go crazy. There are some people who\nnever realize. There are people who are afraid of their officers. It is\nwith them that war is made.”\n\n“I know it is bad but we must finish it.”\n\n“It doesn’t finish. There is no finish to a war.”\n\n“Yes there is.”\n\nPassini shook his head.\n\n“War is not won by victory. What if we take San Gabriele? What if we\ntake the Carso and Monfalcone and Trieste? Where are we then? Did you\nsee all the far mountains to-day? Do you think we could take all them\ntoo? Only if the Austrians stop fighting. One side must stop fighting.\nWhy don’t we stop fighting? If they come down into Italy they will get\ntired and go away. They have their own country. But no, instead there is\na war.”\n\n“You’re an orator.”\n\n“We think. We read. We are not peasants. We are mechanics. But even the\npeasants know better than to believe in a war. Everybody hates this\nwar.”\n\n“There is a class that controls a country that is stupid and does not\nrealize anything and never can. That is why we have this war.”\n\n“Also they make money out of it.”\n\n“Most of them don’t,” said Passini. “They are too stupid. They do it for\nnothing. For stupidity.”\n\n“We must shut up,” said Manera. “We talk too much even for the Tenente.”\n\n“He likes it,” said Passini. “We will convert him.”\n\n“But now we will shut up,” Manera said.\n\n“Do we eat yet, Tenente?” Gavuzzi asked."}
{"text": "“I will go and see,” I said. Gordini stood up and went outside with me.\n\n“Is there anything I can do, Tenente? Can I help in any way?” He was the\nquietest one of the four. “Come with me if you want,” I said, “and we’ll\nsee.”\n\nIt was dark outside and the long light from the search-lights was moving\nover the mountains. There were big search-lights on that front mounted\non camions that you passed sometimes on the roads at night, close behind\nthe lines, the camion stopped a little off the road, an officer\ndirecting the light and the crew scared. We crossed the brickyard, and\nstopped at the main dressing station. There was a little shelter of\ngreen branches outside over the entrance and in the dark the night wind\nrustled the leaves dried by the sun. Inside there was a light. The major\nwas at the telephone sitting on a box. One of the medical captains said\nthe attack had been put forward an hour. He offered me a glass of\ncognac. I looked at the board tables, the instruments shining in the\nlight, the basins and the stoppered bottles. Gordini stood behind me.\nThe major got up from the telephone.\n\n“It starts now,” he said. “It has been put back again.”\n\nI looked outside, it was dark and the Austrian search-lights were moving\non the mountains behind us. It was quiet for a moment still, then from\nall the guns behind us the bombardment started.\n\n“Savoia,” said the major.\n\n“About the soup, major,” I said. He did not hear me. I repeated it.\n\n“It hasn’t come up.”\n\nA big shell came in and burst outside in the brickyard. Another burst\nand in the noise you could hear the smaller noise of the brick and dirt\nraining down.\n\n“What is there to eat?”\n\n“We have a little pasta asciutta,” the major said.\n\n“I’ll take what you can give me.”\n\nThe major spoke to an orderly who went out of sight in the back and came\nback with a metal basin of cold cooked macaroni. I handed it to Gordini.\n\n“Have you any cheese?”\n\nThe major spoke grudgingly to the orderly who ducked back into the hole\nagain and came out with a quarter of a white cheese.\n\n“Thank you very much,” I said.\n\n“You’d better not go out.”\n\nOutside something was set down beside the entrance. One of the two men\nwho had carried it looked in.\n\n“Bring him in,” said the major. “What’s the matter with you? Do you want\nus to come outside and get him?”\n\nThe two stretcher-bearers picked up the man under the arms and by the\nlegs and brought him in.\n\n“Slit the tunic,” the major said.\n\nHe held a forceps with some gauze in the end. The two captains took off\ntheir coats. “Get out of here,” the major said to the two\nstretcher-bearers.\n\n“Come on,” I said to Gordini.\n\n“You better wait until the shelling is over,” the major said over his\nshoulder.\n\n“They want to eat,” I said.\n\n“As you wish.”\n\nOutside we ran across the brickyard. A shell burst short near the river\nbank. Then there was one that we did not hear coming until the sudden\nrush. We both went flat and with the flash and bump of the burst and the\nsmell heard the singing off of the fragments and the rattle of falling\nbrick. Gordini got up and ran for the dugout. I was after him, holding\nthe cheese, its smooth surface covered with brick dust. Inside the\ndugout were the three drivers sitting against the wall, smoking.\n\n“Here, you patriots,” I said.\n\n“How are the cars?” Manera asked.\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Did they scare you, Tenente?”\n\n“You’re damned right,” I said.\n\nI took out my knife, opened it, wiped off the blade and pared off the\ndirty outside surface of the cheese. Gavuzzi handed me the basin of\nmacaroni.\n\n“Start in to eat, Tenente.”\n\n“No,” I said. “Put it on the floor. We’ll all eat.”\n\n“There are no forks.”\n\n“What the hell,” I said in English.\n\nI cut the cheese into pieces and laid them on the macaroni.\n\n“Sit down to it,” I said. They sat down and waited. I put thumb and\nfingers into the macaroni and lifted. A mass loosened.\n\n“Lift it high, Tenente.”\n\nI lifted it to arm’s length and the strands cleared. I lowered it into\nthe mouth, sucked and snapped in the ends, and chewed, then took a bite\nof cheese, chewed, and then a drink of the wine. It tasted of rusty\nmetal. I handed the canteen back to Passini.\n\n“It’s rotten,” he said. “It’s been in there too long. I had it in the\ncar.”"}
{"text": "They were all eating, holding their chins close over the basin, tipping\ntheir heads back, sucking in the ends. I took another mouthful and some\ncheese and a rinse of wine. Something landed outside that shook the\nearth.\n\n“Four hundred twenty or minnenwerfer,” Gavuzzi said.\n\n“There aren’t any four hundred twenties in the mountains,” I said.\n\n“They have big Skoda guns. I’ve seen the holes.”\n\n“Three hundred fives.”\n\nWe went on eating. There was a cough, a noise like a railway engine\nstarting and then an explosion that shook the earth again.\n\n“This isn’t a deep dugout,” Passini said.\n\n“That was a big trench-mortar.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nI ate the end of my piece of cheese and took a swallow of wine. Through\nthe other noise I heard a cough, then came the chuh-chuh-chuh-chuh—then\nthere was a flash, as when a blast-furnace door is swung open, and a\nroar that started white and went red and on and on in a rushing wind. I\ntried to breathe but my breath would not come and I felt myself rush\nbodily out of myself and out and out and out and all the time bodily in\nthe wind. I went out swiftly, all of myself, and I knew I was dead and\nthat it had all been a mistake to think you just died. Then I floated,\nand instead of going on I felt myself slide back. I breathed and I was\nback. The ground was torn up and in front of my head there was a\nsplintered beam of wood. In the jolt of my head I heard somebody crying.\nI thought somebody was screaming. I tried to move but I could not move.\nI heard the machine-guns and rifles firing across the river and all\nalong the river. There was a great splashing and I saw the star-shells\ngo up and burst and float whitely and rockets going up and heard the\nbombs, all this in a moment, and then I heard close to me some one\nsaying “Mama Mia! Oh, mama Mia!” I pulled and twisted and got my legs\nloose finally and turned around and touched him. It was Passini and when\nI touched him he screamed. His legs were toward me and I saw in the dark\nand the light that they were both smashed above the knee. One leg was\ngone and the other was held by tendons and part of the trouser and the\nstump twitched and jerked as though it were not connected. He bit his\narm and moaned, “Oh mama mia, mama Mia,” then, “Dio te salve, Maria. Dio\nte salve, Maria. Oh Jesus shoot me Christ shoot me mama mia mama Mia oh\npurest lovely Mary shoot me. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Oh Jesus lovely\nMary stop it. Oh oh oh oh,” then choking, “Mama mama mia.” Then he was\nquiet, biting his arm, the stump of his leg twitching.\n\n“Porta feriti!” I shouted holding my hands cupped. “Porta Feriti!” I\ntried to get closer to Passini to try to put a tourniquet on the legs\nbut I could not move. I tried again and my legs moved a little. I could\npull backward along with my arms and elbows. Passini was quiet now. I\nsat beside him, undid my tunic and tried to rip the tail of my shirt. It\nwould not rip and I bit the edge of the cloth to start it. Then I\nthought of his puttees. I had on wool stockings but Passini wore\nputtees. All the drivers wore puttees but Passini had only one leg. I\nunwound the puttee and while I was doing it I saw there was no need to\ntry and make a tourniquet because he was dead already. I made sure he\nwas dead. There were three others to locate. I sat up straight and as I\ndid so something inside my head moved like the weights on a doll’s eyes\nand it hit me inside in back of my eyeballs. My legs felt warm and wet\nand my shoes were wet and warm inside. I knew that I was hit and leaned\nover and put my hand on my knee. My knee wasn’t there. My hand went in\nand my knee was down on my shin. I wiped my hand on my shirt and another\nfloating light came very slowly down and I looked at my leg and was very\nafraid. Oh, God, I said, get me out of here. I knew, however, that there\nhad been three others. There were four drivers. Passini was dead. That\nleft three. Some one took hold of me under the arms and somebody else\nlifted my legs.\n\n“There are three others,” I said. “One is dead.”\n\n“It’s Manera. We went for a stretcher but there wasn’t any. How are you,\nTenente?”\n\n“Where is Gordini and Gavuzzi?”"}
{"text": "“Gordini’s at the post getting bandaged. Gavuzzi has your legs. Hold on\nto my neck, Tenente. Are you badly hit?”\n\n“In the leg. How is Gordini?”\n\n“He’s all right. It was a big trench-mortar shell.”\n\n“Passini’s dead.”\n\n“Yes. He’s dead.”\n\nA shell fell close and they both dropped to the ground and dropped me.\n“I’m sorry, Tenente,” said Manera. “Hang onto my neck.”\n\n“If you drop me again.”\n\n“It was because we were scared.”\n\n“Are you unwounded?”\n\n“We are both wounded a little.”\n\n“Can Gordini drive?”\n\n“I don’t think so.”\n\nThey dropped me once more before we reached the post.\n\n“You sons of bitches,” I said.\n\n“I am sorry, Tenente,” Manera said. “We won’t drop you again.”\n\nOutside the post a great many of us lay on the ground in the dark. They\ncarried wounded in and brought them out. I could see the light come out\nfrom the dressing station when the curtain opened and they brought some\none in or out. The dead were off to one side. The doctors were working\nwith their sleeves up to their shoulders and were red as butchers. There\nwere not enough stretchers. Some of the wounded were noisy but most were\nquiet. The wind blew the leaves in the bower over the door of the\ndressing station and the night was getting cold. Stretcher-bearers came\nin all the time, put their stretchers down, unloaded them and went away.\nAs soon as I got to the dressing station Manera brought a medical\nsergeant out and he put bandages on both my legs. He said there was so\nmuch dirt blown into the wound that there had not been much hemorrhage.\nThey would take me as soon as possible. He went back inside. Gordini\ncould not drive, Manera said. His shoulder was smashed and his head was\nhurt. He had not felt bad but now the shoulder had stiffened. He was\nsitting up beside one of the brick walls. Manera and Gavuzzi each went\noff with a load of wounded. They could drive all right. The British had\ncome with three ambulances and they had two men on each ambulance. One\nof their drivers came over to me, brought by Gordini who looked very\nwhite and sick. The Britisher leaned over.\n\n“Are you hit badly?” he asked. He was a tall man and wore steel-rimmed\nspectacles.\n\n“In the legs.”\n\n“It’s not serious I hope. Will you have a cigarette?”\n\n“Thanks.”\n\n“They tell me you’ve lost two drivers.”\n\n“Yes. One killed and the fellow that brought you.”\n\n“What rotten luck. Would you like us to take the cars?”\n\n“That’s what I wanted to ask you.”\n\n“We’d take quite good care of them and return them to the Villa. 206\naren’t you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It’s a charming place. I’ve seen you about. They tell me you’re an\nAmerican.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I’m English.”\n\n“No!”\n\n“Yes, English. Did you think I was Italian? There were some Italians\nwith one of our units.”\n\n“It would be fine if you would take the cars,” I said.\n\n“We’ll be most careful of them,” he straightened up. “This chap of yours\nwas very anxious for me to see you.” He patted Gordini on the shoulder.\nGordini winced and smiled. The Englishman broke into voluble and perfect\nItalian. “Now everything is arranged. I’ve seen your Tenente. We will\ntake over the two cars. You won’t worry now.” He broke off, “I must do\nsomething about getting you out of here. I’ll see the medical wallahs.\nWe’ll take you back with us.”\n\nHe walked across to the dressing station, stepping carefully among the\nwounded. I saw the blanket open, the light came out and he went in.\n\n“He will look after you, Tenente,” Gordini said.\n\n“How are you, Franco?”\n\n“I am all right.” He sat down beside me. In a moment the blanket in\nfront of the dressing station opened and two stretcher-bearers came out\nfollowed by the tall Englishman. He brought them over to me.\n\n“Here is the American Tenente,” he said in Italian.\n\n“I’d rather wait,” I said. “There are much worse wounded than me. I’m\nall right.”\n\n“Come come,” he said. “Don’t be a bloody hero.” Then in Italian: “Lift\nhim very carefully about the legs. His legs are very painful. He is the\nlegitimate son of President Wilson.” They picked me up and took me into\nthe dressing room. Inside they were operating on all the tables. The\nlittle major looked at us furious. He recognized me and waved a forceps.\n\n“Ça va bien?”\n\n“Ça va.”"}
{"text": "“I have brought him in,” the tall Englishman said in Italian. “The only\nson of the American Ambassador. He can be here until you are ready to\ntake him. Then I will take him with my first load.” He bent over me.\n“I’ll look up their adjutant to do your papers and it will all go much\nfaster.” He stooped to go under the doorway and went out. The major was\nunhooking the forceps now, dropping them in a basin. I followed his\nhands with my eyes. Now he was bandaging. Then the stretcher-bearers\ntook the man off the table.\n\n“I’ll take the American Tenente,” one of the captains said. They lifted\nme onto the table. It was hard and slippery. There were many strong\nsmells, chemical smells and the sweet smell of blood. They took off my\ntrousers and the medical captain commenced dictating to the\nsergeant-adjutant while he worked, “Multiple superficial wounds of the\nleft and right thigh and left and right knee and right foot. Profound\nwounds of right knee and foot. Lacerations of the scalp (he probed—Does\nthat hurt?—Christ, yes!) with possible fracture of the skull. Incurred\nin the line of duty. That’s what keeps you from being court-martialled\nfor self-inflicted wounds,” he said. “Would you like a drink of brandy?\nHow did you run into this thing anyway? What were you trying to do?\nCommit suicide? Anti-tetanus please, and mark a cross on both legs.\nThank you. I’ll clean this up a little, wash it out, and put on a\ndressing. Your blood coagulates beautifully.”\n\nThe adjutant, looking up from the paper, “What inflicted the wounds?”\n\nThe medical captain, “What hit you?”\n\nMe, with the eyes shut, “A trench mortar shell.”\n\nThe captain, doing things that hurt sharply and severing tissue—“Are\nyou sure?”\n\nMe—trying to lie still and feeling my stomach flutter when the flesh\nwas cut, “I think so.”\n\nCaptain doctor—(interested in something he was finding), “Fragments of\nenemy trench-mortar shell. Now I’ll probe for some of this if you like\nbut it’s not necessary. I’ll paint all this and—Does that sting? Good,\nthat’s nothing to how it will feel later. The pain hasn’t started yet.\nBring him a glass of brandy. The shock dulls the pain; but this is all\nright, you have nothing to worry about if it doesn’t infect and it\nrarely does now. How is your head?”\n\n“Good Christ!” I said.\n\n“Better not drink too much brandy then. If you’ve got a fracture you\ndon’t want inflammation. How does that feel?”\n\nSweat ran all over me.\n\n“Good Christ!” I said.\n\n“I guess you’ve got a fracture all right. I’ll wrap you up and don’t\nbounce your head around.” He bandaged, his hands moving very fast and\nthe bandage coming taut and sure. “All right, good luck and Vive la\nFrance.”\n\n“He’s an American,” one of the other captains said.\n\n“I thought you said he was a Frenchman. He talks French,” the captain\nsaid. “I’ve known him before. I always thought he was French.” He drank\na half tumbler of cognac. “Bring on something serious. Get some more of\nthat Anti-tetanus.” The captain waved to me. They lifted me and the\nblanket-flap went across my face as we went out. Outside the\nsergeant-adjutant knelt down beside me where I lay, “Name?” he asked\nsoftly. “Middle name? First name? Rank? Where born? What class? What\ncorps?” and so on. “I’m sorry for your head, Tenente. I hope you feel\nbetter. I’m sending you now with the English ambulance.”\n\n“I’m all right,” I said. “Thank you very much.” The pain that the major\nhad spoken about had started and all that was happening was without\ninterest or relation. After a while the English ambulance came up and\nthey put me onto a stretcher and lifted the stretcher up to the\nambulance level and shoved it in. There was another stretcher by the\nside with a man on it whose nose I could see, waxy-looking, out of the\nbandages. He breathed very heavily. There were stretchers lifted and\nslid into the slings above. The tall English driver came around and\nlooked in, “I’ll take it very easily,” he said. “I hope you’ll be\ncomfy.” I felt the engine start, felt him climb up into the front seat,\nfelt the brake come off and the clutch go in, then we started. I lay\nstill and let the pain ride."}
{"text": "As the ambulance climbed along the road, it was slow in the traffic,\nsometimes it stopped, sometimes it backed on a turn, then finally it\nclimbed quite fast. I felt something dripping. At first it dropped\nslowly and regularly, then it pattered into a stream. I shouted to the\ndriver. He stopped the car and looked in through the hole behind his\nseat.\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“The man on the stretcher over me has a hemorrhage.”\n\n“We’re not far from the top. I wouldn’t be able to get the stretcher out\nalone.” He started the car. The stream kept on. In the dark I could not\nsee where it came from the canvas overhead. I tried to move sideways so\nthat it did not fall on me. Where it had run down under my shirt it was\nwarm and sticky. I was cold and my leg hurt so that it made me sick.\nAfter a while the stream from the stretcher above lessened and started\nto drip again and I heard and felt the canvas above move as the man on\nthe stretcher settled more comfortably.\n\n“How is he?” the Englishman called back. “We’re almost up.”\n\n“He’s dead I think,” I said.\n\nThe drops fell very slowly, as they fall from an icicle after the sun\nhas gone. It was cold in the car in the night as the road climbed. At\nthe post on the top they took the stretcher out and put another in and\nwe went on.\n\nIn the ward at the field hospital they told me a visitor was coming to\nsee me in the afternoon. It was a hot day and there were many flies in\nthe room. My orderly had cut paper into strips and tied the strips to a\nstick to make a brush that swished the flies away. I watched them settle\non the ceiling. When he stopped swishing and fell asleep they came down\nand I blew them away and finally covered my face with my hands and slept\ntoo. It was very hot and when I woke my legs itched. I waked the orderly\nand he poured mineral water on the dressings. That made the bed damp and\ncool. Those of us that were awake talked across the ward. The afternoon\nwas a quiet time. In the morning they came to each bed in turn, three\nmen nurses and a doctor and picked you up out of bed and carried you\ninto the dressing room so that the beds could be made while we were\nhaving our wounds dressed. It was not a pleasant trip to the dressing\nroom and I did not know until later that beds could be made with men in\nthem. My orderly had finished pouring water and the bed felt cool and\nlovely and I was telling him where to scratch on the soles of my feet\nagainst the itching when one of the doctors brought in Rinaldi. He came\nin very fast and bent down over the bed and kissed me. I saw he wore\ngloves.\n\n“How are you, baby? How do you feel? I bring you this—” It was a bottle\nof cognac. The orderly brought a chair and he sat down, “and good news.\nYou will be decorated. They want to get you the medaglia d’argento but\nperhaps they can get only the bronze.”\n\n“What for?”\n\n“Because you are gravely wounded. They say if you can prove you did any\nheroic act you can get the silver. Otherwise it will be the bronze. Tell\nme exactly what happened. Did you do any heroic act?”\n\n“No,” I said. “I was blown up while we were eating cheese.”\n\n“Be serious. You must have done something heroic either before or after.\nRemember carefully.”\n\n“I did not.”\n\n“Didn’t you carry anybody on your back? Gordini says you carried several\npeople on your back but the medical major at the first post declares it\nis impossible. He has to sign the proposition for the citation.”\n\n“I didn’t carry anybody. I couldn’t move.”\n\n“That doesn’t matter,” said Rinaldi.\n\nHe took off his gloves.\n\n“I think we can get you the silver. Didn’t you refuse to be medically\naided before the others?”\n\n“Not very firmly.”\n\n“That doesn’t matter. Look how you are wounded. Look at your valorous\nconduct in asking to go always to the first line. Besides, the operation\nwas successful.”\n\n“Did they cross the river all right?”\n\n“Enormously. They take nearly a thousand prisoners. It’s in the\nbulletin. Didn’t you see it?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I’ll bring it to you. It is a successful coup de main.”\n\n“How is everything?”"}
{"text": "“Splendid. We are all splendid. Everybody is proud of you. Tell me just\nexactly how it happened. I am positive you will get the silver. Go on\ntell me. Tell me all about it.” He paused and thought. “Maybe you will\nget an English medal too. There was an English there. I’ll go and see\nhim and ask if he will recommend you. He ought to be able to do\nsomething. Do you suffer much? Have a drink. Orderly, go get a\ncorkscrew. Oh you should see what I did in the removal of three metres\nof small intestine and better now than ever. It is one for _The Lancet_.\nYou do me a translation and I will send it to _The Lancet_. Every day I\nam better. Poor dear baby, how do you feel? Where is that damn\ncorkscrew? You are so brave and quiet I forget you are suffering.” He\nslapped his gloves on the edge of the bed.\n\n“Here is the corkscrew, Signor Tenente,” the orderly said.\n\n“Open the bottle. Bring a glass. Drink that, baby. How is your poor\nhead? I looked at your papers. You haven’t any fracture. That major at\nthe first post was a hog-butcher. I would take you and never hurt you. I\nnever hurt anybody. I learn how to do it. Every day I learn to do things\nsmoother and better. You must forgive me for talking so much, baby. I am\nvery moved to see you badly wounded. There, drink that. It’s good. It\ncost fifteen lire. It ought to be good. Five stars. After I leave here\nI’ll go see that English and he’ll get you an English medal.”\n\n“They don’t give them like that.”\n\n“You are so modest. I will send the liaison officer. He can handle the\nEnglish.”\n\n“Have you seen Miss Barkley?”\n\n“I will bring her here. I will go now and bring her here.”\n\n“Don’t go,” I said. “Tell me about Gorizia. How are the girls?”\n\n“There are no girls. For two weeks now they haven’t changed them. I\ndon’t go there any more. It is disgraceful. They aren’t girls; they are\nold war comrades.”\n\n“You don’t go at all?”\n\n“I just go to see if there is anything new. I stop by. They all ask for\nyou. It is a disgrace that they should stay so long that they become\nfriends.”\n\n“Maybe girls don’t want to go to the front any more.”\n\n“Of course they do. They have plenty of girls. It is just bad\nadministration. They are keeping them for the pleasure of dugout hiders\nin the rear.”\n\n“Poor Rinaldi,” I said. “All alone at the war with no new girls.”\n\nRinaldi poured himself another glass of the cognac.\n\n“I don’t think it will hurt you, baby. You take it.”\n\nI drank the cognac and felt it warm all the way down. Rinaldi poured\nanother glass. He was quieter now. He held up the glass. “To your\nvalorous wounds. To the silver medal. Tell me, baby, when you lie here\nall the time in the hot weather don’t you get excited?”\n\n“Sometimes.”\n\n“I can’t imagine lying like that. I would go crazy.”\n\n“You are crazy.”\n\n“I wish you were back. No one to come in at night from adventures. No\none to make fun of. No one to lend me money. No blood brother and\nroommate. Why do you get yourself wounded?”\n\n“You can make fun of the priest.”\n\n“That priest. It isn’t me that makes fun of him. It is the captain. I\nlike him. If you must have a priest have that priest. He’s coming to see\nyou. He makes big preparations.”\n\n“I like him.”\n\n“Oh, I knew it. Sometimes I think you and he are a little that way. You\nknow.”\n\n“No, you don’t.”\n\n“Yes, I do sometimes. A little that way like the number of the first\nregiment of the Brigata Ancona.”\n\n“Oh, go to hell.”\n\nHe stood up and put on his gloves.\n\n“Oh I love to tease you, baby. With your priest and your English girl,\nand really you are just like me underneath.”\n\n“No, I’m not.”\n\n“Yes, we are. You are really an Italian. All fire and smoke and nothing\ninside. You only pretend to be American. We are brothers and we love\neach other.”\n\n“Be good while I’m gone,” I said.\n\n“I will send Miss Barkley. You are better with her without me. You are\npurer and sweeter.”\n\n“Oh, go to hell.”\n\n“I will send her. Your lovely cool goddess. English goddess. My God what\nwould a man do with a woman like that except worship her? What else is\nan Englishwoman good for?”\n\n“You are an ignorant foul-mouthed dago.”\n\n“A what?”\n\n“An ignorant wop.”\n\n“Wop. You are a frozen-faced ... wop.”"}
{"text": "“You are ignorant. Stupid.” I saw that word pricked him and kept on.\n“Uninformed. Inexperienced, stupid from inexperience.”\n\n“Truly? I tell you something about your good women. Your goddesses.\nThere is only one difference between taking a girl who has always been\ngood and a woman. With a girl it is painful. That’s all I know.” He\nslapped the bed with his glove. “And you never know if the girl will\nreally like it.”\n\n“Don’t get angry.”\n\n“I’m not angry. I just tell you, baby, for your own good. To save you\ntrouble.”\n\n“That’s the only difference?”\n\n“Yes. But millions of fools like you don’t know it.”\n\n“You were sweet to tell me.”\n\n“We won’t quarrel, baby. I love you too much. But don’t be a fool.”\n\n“No. I’ll be wise like you.”\n\n“Don’t be angry, baby. Laugh. Take a drink. I must go, really.”\n\n“You’re a good old boy.”\n\n“Now you see. Underneath we are the same. We are war brothers. Kiss me\ngood-by.”\n\n“You’re sloppy.”\n\n“No. I am just more affectionate.”\n\nI felt his breath come toward me. “Good-by. I come to see you again\nsoon.” His breath went away. “I won’t kiss you if you don’t want. I’ll\nsend your English girl. Good-by, baby. The cognac is under the bed. Get\nwell soon.”\n\nHe was gone.\n\nIt was dusk when the priest came. They had brought the soup and\nafterward taken away the bowls and I was lying looking at the rows of\nbeds and out the window at the tree-top that moved a little in the\nevening breeze. The breeze came in through the window and it was cooler\nwith the evening. The flies were on the ceiling now and on the electric\nlight bulbs that hung on wires. The lights were only turned on when some\none was brought in at night or when something was being done. It made me\nfeel very young to have the dark come after the dusk and then remain. It\nwas like being put to bed after early supper. The orderly came down\nbetween the beds and stopped. Some one was with him. It was the priest.\nHe stood there small, brown-faced, and embarrassed.\n\n“How do you do?” he asked. He put some packages down by the bed, on the\nfloor.\n\n“All right, father.”\n\nHe sat down in the chair that had been brought for Rinaldi and looked\nout of the window embarrassedly. I noticed his face looked very tired.\n\n“I can only stay a minute,” he said. “It is late.”\n\n“It’s not late. How is the mess?”\n\nHe smiled. “I am still a great joke,” he sounded tired too. “Thank God\nthey are all well.”\n\n“I am so glad you are all right,” he said. “I hope you don’t suffer.” He\nseemed very tired and I was not used to seeing him tired.\n\n“Not any more.”\n\n“I miss you at the mess.”\n\n“I wish I were there. I always enjoyed our talking.”\n\n“I brought you a few little things,” he said. He picked up the packages.\n“This is mosquito netting. This is a bottle of vermouth. You like\nvermouth? These are English papers.”\n\n“Please open them.”\n\nHe was pleased and undid them. I held the mosquito netting in my hands.\nThe vermouth he held up for me to see and then put it on the floor\nbeside the bed. I held up one of the sheaf of English papers. I could\nread the headlines by turning it so the half-light from the window was\non it. It was the _News of the World_.\n\n“The others are illustrated,” he said.\n\n“It will be a great happiness to read them. Where did you get them?”\n\n“I sent for them to Mestre. I will have more.”\n\n“You were very good to come, father. Will you drink a glass of\nvermouth?”\n\n“Thank you. You keep it. It’s for you.”\n\n“No, drink a glass.”\n\n“All right. I will bring you more then.”\n\nThe orderly brought the glasses and opened the bottle. He broke off the\ncork and the end had to be shoved down into the bottle. I could see the\npriest was disappointed but he said, “That’s all right. It’s no matter.”\n\n“Here’s to your health, father.”\n\n“To your better health.”\n\nAfterward he held the glass in his hand and we looked at one another.\nSometimes we talked and were good friends but to-night it was difficult.\n\n“What’s the matter, father? You seem very tired.”\n\n“I am tired but I have no right to be.”\n\n“It’s the heat.”\n\n“No. This is only the Spring. I feel very low.”\n\n“You have the war disgust.”\n\n“No. But I hate the war.”\n\n“I don’t enjoy it,” I said. He shook his head and looked out of the\nwindow."}
{"text": "“You do not mind it. You do not see it. You must forgive me. I know you\nare wounded.”\n\n“That is an accident.”\n\n“Still even wounded you do not see it. I can tell. I do not see it\nmyself but I feel it a little.”\n\n“When I was wounded we were talking about it. Passini was talking.”\n\nThe priest put down the glass. He was thinking about something else.\n\n“I know them because I am like they are,” he said.\n\n“You are different though.”\n\n“But really I am like they are.”\n\n“The officers don’t see anything.”\n\n“Some of them do. Some are very delicate and feel worse than any of us.”\n\n“They are mostly different.”\n\n“It is not education or money. It is something else. Even if they had\neducation or money men like Passini would not wish to be officers. I\nwould not be an officer.”\n\n“You rank as an officer. I am an officer.”\n\n“I am not really. You are not even an Italian. You are a foreigner. But\nyou are nearer the officers than you are to the men.”\n\n“What is the difference?”\n\n“I cannot say it easily. There are people who would make war. In this\ncountry there are many like that. There are other people who would not\nmake war.”\n\n“But the first ones make them do it.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And I help them.”\n\n“You are a foreigner. You are a patriot.”\n\n“And the ones who would not make war? Can they stop it?”\n\n“I do not know.”\n\nHe looked out of the window again. I watched his face.\n\n“Have they ever been able to stop it?”\n\n“They are not organized to stop things and when they get organized their\nleaders sell them out.”\n\n“Then it’s hopeless?”\n\n“It is never hopeless. But sometimes I cannot hope. I try always to hope\nbut sometimes I cannot.”\n\n“Maybe the war will be over.”\n\n“I hope so.”\n\n“What will you do then?”\n\n“If it is possible I will return to the Abruzzi.”\n\nHis brown face was suddenly very happy.\n\n“You love the Abruzzi!”\n\n“Yes, I love it very much.”\n\n“You ought to go there then.”\n\n“I would be too happy. If I could live there and love God and serve\nHim.”\n\n“And be respected,” I said.\n\n“Yes and be respected. Why not?”\n\n“No reason not. You should be respected.”\n\n“It does not matter. But there in my country it is understood that a man\nmay love God. It is not a dirty joke.”\n\n“I understand.”\n\nHe looked at me and smiled.\n\n“You understand but you do not love God.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You do not love Him at all?” he asked.\n\n“I am afraid of him in the night sometimes.”\n\n“You should love Him.”\n\n“I don’t love much.”\n\n“Yes,” he said. “You do. What you tell me about in the nights. That is\nnot love. That is only passion and lust. When you love you wish to do\nthings for. You wish to sacrifice for. You wish to serve.”\n\n“I don’t love.”\n\n“You will. I know you will. Then you will be happy.”\n\n“I’m happy. I’ve always been happy.”\n\n“It is another thing. You cannot know about it unless you have it.”\n\n“Well,” I said. “If I ever get it I will tell you.”\n\n“I stay too long and talk too much.” He was worried that he really did.\n\n“No. Don’t go. How about loving women? If I really loved some woman\nwould it be like that?”\n\n“I don’t know about that. I never loved any woman.”\n\n“What about your mother?”\n\n“Yes, I must have loved my mother.”\n\n“Did you always love God?”\n\n“Ever since I was a little boy.”\n\n“Well,” I said. I did not know what to say. “You are a fine boy,” I\nsaid.\n\n“I am a boy,” he said. “But you call me father.”\n\n“That’s politeness.”\n\nHe smiled.\n\n“I must go, really,” he said. “You do not want me for anything?” he\nasked hopefully.\n\n“No. Just to talk.”\n\n“I will take your greetings to the mess.”\n\n“Thank you for the many fine presents.”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Come and see me again.”\n\n“Yes. Good-by,” he patted my hand.\n\n“So long,” I said in dialect.\n\n“Ciaou,” he repeated."}
{"text": "It was dark in the room and the orderly, who had sat by the foot of the\nbed, got up and went out with him. I liked him very much and I hoped he\nwould get back to the Abruzzi some time. He had a rotten life in the\nmess and he was fine about it but I thought how he would be in his own\ncountry. At Capracotta, he had told me, there were trout in the stream\nbelow the town. It was forbidden to play the flute at night. When the\nyoung men serenaded only the flute was forbidden. Why, I had asked.\nBecause it was bad for the girls to hear the flute at night. The\npeasants all called you “Don” and when you met them they took off their\nhats. His father hunted every day and stopped to eat at the houses of\npeasants. They were always honored. For a foreigner to hunt he must\npresent a certificate that he had never been arrested. There were bears\non the Gran Sasso D’Italia but it was a long way. Aquila was a fine\ntown. It was cool in the summer at night and the spring in Abruzzi was\nthe most beautiful in Italy. But what was lovely was the fall to go\nhunting through the chestnut woods. The birds were all good because they\nfed on grapes and you never took a lunch because the peasants were\nalways honored if you would eat with them at their houses. After a while\nI went to sleep.\n\nThe room was long with windows on the right-hand side and a door at the\nfar end that went into the dressing room. The row of beds that mine was\nin faced the windows and another row, under the windows, faced the wall.\nIf you lay on your left side you could see the dressing room door. There\nwas another door at the far end that people sometimes came in by. If any\none were going to die they put a screen around the bed so you could not\nsee them die, but only the shoes and puttees of doctors and men nurses\nshowed under the bottom of the screen and sometimes at the end there\nwould be whispering. Then the priest would come out from behind the\nscreen and afterward the men nurses would go back behind the screen to\ncome out again carrying the one who was dead with a blanket over him\ndown the corridor between the beds and some one folded the screen and\ntook it away.\n\nThat morning the major in charge of the ward asked me if I felt that I\ncould travel the next day. I said I could. He said then they would ship\nme out early in the morning. He said I would be better off making the\ntrip now before it got too hot.\n\nWhen they lifted you up out of bed to carry you into the dressing room\nyou could look out of the window and see the new graves in the garden. A\nsoldier sat outside the door that opened onto the garden making crosses\nand painting on them the names, rank, and regiment of the men who were\nburied in the garden. He also ran errands for the ward and in his spare\ntime made me a cigarette lighter out of an empty Austrian rifle\ncartridge. The doctors were very nice and seemed very capable. They were\nanxious to ship me to Milan where there were better X-ray facilities and\nwhere, after the operation, I could take mechano-therapy. I wanted to go\nto Milan too. They wanted to get us all out and back as far as possible\nbecause all the beds were needed for the offensive, when it should\nstart.\n\nThe night before I left the field hospital Rinaldi came in to see me\nwith the major from our mess. They said that I would go to an American\nhospital in Milan that had just been installed. Some American ambulance\nunits were to be sent down and this hospital would look after them and\nany other Americans on service in Italy. There were many in the Red\nCross. The States had declared war on Germany but not on Austria."}
{"text": "The Italians were sure America would declare war on Austria too and they\nwere very excited about any Americans coming down, even the Red Cross.\nThey asked me if I thought President Wilson would declare war on Austria\nand I said it was only a matter of days. I did not know what we had\nagainst Austria but it seemed logical that they should declare war on\nher if they did on Germany. They asked me if we would declare war on\nTurkey. I said that was doubtful. Turkey, I said, was our national bird\nbut the joke translated so badly and they were so puzzled and suspicious\nthat I said yes, we would probably declare war on Turkey. And on\nBulgaria? We had drunk several glasses of brandy and I said yes by God\non Bulgaria too and on Japan. But, they said, Japan is an ally of\nEngland. You can’t trust the bloody English. The Japanese want Hawaii, I\nsaid. Where is Hawaii? It is in the Pacific Ocean. Why do the Japanese\nwant it? They don’t really want it, I said. That is all talk. The\nJapanese are a wonderful little people fond of dancing and light wines.\nLike the French, said the major. We will get Nice and Savoia from the\nFrench. We will get Corsica and all the Adriatic coast-line, Rinaldi\nsaid. Italy will return to the splendors of Rome, said the major. I\ndon’t like Rome, I said. It is hot and full of fleas. You don’t like\nRome? Yes, I love Rome. Rome is the mother of nations. I will never\nforget Romulus suckling the Tiber. What? Nothing. Let’s all go to Rome.\nLet’s go to Rome to-night and never come back. Rome is a beautiful city,\nsaid the major. The mother and father of nations, I said. Roma is\nfeminine, said Rinaldi. It cannot be the father. Who is the father,\nthen, the Holy Ghost? Don’t blaspheme. I wasn’t blaspheming, I was\nasking for information. You are drunk, baby. Who made me drunk? I made\nyou drunk, said the major. I made you drunk because I love you and\nbecause America is in the war. Up to the hilt, I said. You go away in\nthe morning, baby, Rinaldi said. To Rome, I said. No, to Milan. To\nMilan, said the major, to the Crystal Palace, to the Cova, to Campari’s,\nto Biffi’s, to the galleria. You lucky boy. To the Gran Italia I said,\nwhere I will borrow money from George. To the Scala, said Rinaldi. You\nwill go to the Scala. Every night, I said. You won’t be able to afford\nit every night, said the major."}
{"text": "The tickets are very expensive. I will draw a sight draft on my\ngrandfather, I said. A what? A sight draft. He has to pay or I go to\njail. Mr. Cunningham at the bank does it. I live by sight drafts. Can a\ngrandfather jail a patriotic grandson who is dying that Italy may live?\nLive the American Garibaldi, said Rinaldi. Viva the sight drafts, I\nsaid. We must be quiet, said the major. Already we have been asked many\ntimes to be quiet. Do you go to-morrow really, Federico? He goes to the\nAmerican hospital I tell you, Rinaldi said. To the beautiful nurses. Not\nthe nurses with beards of the field hospital. Yes, yes, said the major,\nI know he goes to the American hospital. I don’t mind their beards, I\nsaid. If any man wants to raise a beard let him. Why don’t you raise a\nbeard, Signor Maggiore? It could not go in a gas mask. Yes it could.\nAnything can go in a gas mask. I’ve vomited into a gas mask. Don’t be so\nloud, baby, Rinaldi said. We all know you have been at the front. Oh,\nyou fine baby, what will I do while you are gone? We must go, said the\nmajor. This becomes sentimental. Listen, I have a surprise for you. Your\nEnglish. You know? The English you go to see every night at their\nhospital? She is going to Milan too. She goes with another to be at the\nAmerican hospital. They had not got nurses yet from America. I talked\nto-day with the head of their riparto. They have too many women here at\nthe front. They send some back. How do you like that, baby? All right.\nYes? You go to live in a big city and have your English there to cuddle\nyou. Why don’t I get wounded? Maybe you will, I said. We must go, said\nthe major. We drink and make noise and disturb Federico. Don’t go. Yes,\nwe must go. Good-by. Good luck. Many things. Ciaou. Ciaou. Ciaou. Come\nback quickly, baby. Rinaldi kissed me. You smell of lysol. Good-by,\nbaby. Good-by. Many things. The major patted my shoulder. They tiptoed\nout. I found I was quite drunk but went to sleep.\n\nThe next day in the morning we left for Milan and arrived forty-eight\nhours later. It was a bad trip. We were sidetracked for a long time this\nside of Mestre and children came and peeked in. I got a little boy to go\nfor a bottle of cognac but he came back and said he could only get\ngrappa. I told him to get it and when it came I gave him the change and\nthe man beside me and I got drunk and slept until past Vicenza where I\nwoke up and was very sick on the floor. It did not matter because the\nman on that side had been very sick on the floor several times before.\nAfterward I thought I could not stand the thirst and in the yards\noutside of Verona I called to a soldier who was walking up and down\nbeside the train and he got me a drink of water. I woke Georgetti, the\nother boy who was drunk, and offered him some water. He said to pour it\non his shoulder and went back to sleep. The soldier would not take the\npenny I offered him and brought me a pulpy orange. I sucked on that and\nspit out the pith and watched the soldier pass up and down past a\nfreight-car outside and after a while the train gave a jerk and started.\n\nWe got into Milan early in the morning and they unloaded us in the\nfreight yard. An ambulance took me to the American hospital. Riding in\nthe ambulance on a stretcher I could not tell what part of town we were\npassing through but when they unloaded the stretcher I saw a\nmarket-place and an open wine shop with a girl sweeping out. They were\nwatering the street and it smelled of the early morning. They put the\nstretcher down and went in. The porter came out with them. He had gray\nmustaches, wore a doorman’s cap and was in his shirt sleeves. The\nstretcher would not go into the elevator and they discussed whether it\nwas better to lift me off the stretcher and go up in the elevator or\ncarry the stretcher up the stairs. I listened to them discussing it.\nThey decided on the elevator. They lifted me from the stretcher. “Go\neasy,” I said. “Take it softly.”\n\nIn the elevator we were crowded and as my legs bent the pain was very\nbad. “Straighten out the legs,” I said."}
{"text": "“We can’t, Signor Tenente. There isn’t room.” The man who said this had\nhis arm around me and my arm was around his neck. His breath came in my\nface metallic with garlic and red wine.\n\n“Be gentle,” the other man said.\n\n“Son of a bitch who isn’t gentle!”\n\n“Be gentle I say,” the man with my feet repeated.\n\nI saw the doors of the elevator closed, and the grill shut and the\nfourth-floor button pushed by the porter. The porter looked worried. The\nelevator rose slowly.\n\n“Heavy?” I asked the man with the garlic.\n\n“Nothing,” he said. His face was sweating and he grunted. The elevator\nrose steadily and stopped. The man holding the feet opened the door and\nstepped out. We were on a balcony. There were several doors with brass\nknobs. The man carrying the feet pushed a button that rang a bell. We\nheard it inside the doors. No one came. Then the porter came up the\nstairs.\n\n“Where are they?” the stretcher-bearers asked.\n\n“I don’t know,” said the porter. “They sleep down stairs.”\n\n“Get somebody.”\n\nThe porter rang the bell, then knocked on the door, then he opened the\ndoor and went in. When he came back there was an elderly woman wearing\nglasses with him. Her hair was loose and half-falling and she wore a\nnurse’s dress.\n\n“I can’t understand,” she said. “I can’t understand Italian.”\n\n“I can speak English,” I said. “They want to put me somewhere.”\n\n“None of the rooms are ready. There isn’t any patient expected.” She\ntucked at her hair and looked at me near-sightedly.\n\n“Show them any room where they can put me.”\n\n“I don’t know,” she said. “There’s no patient expected. I couldn’t put\nyou in just any room.”\n\n“Any room will do,” I said. Then to the porter in Italian, “Find an\nempty room.”\n\n“They are all empty,” said the porter. “You are the first patient.” He\nheld his cap in his hand and looked at the elderly nurse.\n\n“For Christ’s sweet sake take me to some room.” The pain had gone on and\non with the legs bent and I could feel it going in and out of the bone.\nThe porter went in the door, followed by the gray-haired woman, then\ncame hurrying back. “Follow me,” he said. They carried me down a long\nhallway and into a room with drawn blinds. It smelled of new furniture.\nThere was a bed and a big wardrobe with a mirror. They laid me down on\nthe bed.\n\n“I can’t put on sheets,” the woman said. “The sheets are locked up.”\n\nI did not speak to her. “There is money in my pocket,” I said to the\nporter. “In the buttoned-down pocket.” The porter took out the money.\nThe two stretcher-bearers stood beside the bed holding their caps. “Give\nthem five lire apiece and five lire for yourself. My papers are in the\nother pocket. You may give them to the nurse.”\n\nThe stretcher-bearers saluted and said thank you. “Good-by,” I said.\n“And many thanks.” They saluted again and went out.\n\n“Those papers,” I said to the nurse, “describe my case and the treatment\nalready given.”\n\nThe woman picked them up and looked at them through her glasses. There\nwere three papers and they were folded. “I don’t know what to do,” she\nsaid. “I can’t read Italian. I can’t do anything without the doctor’s\norders.” She commenced to cry and put the papers in her apron pocket.\n“Are you an American?” she asked crying.\n\n“Yes. Please put the papers on the table by the bed.”\n\nIt was dim and cool in the room. As I lay on the bed I could see the big\nmirror on the other side of the room but could not see what it\nreflected. The porter stood by the bed. He had a nice face and was very\nkind.\n\n“You can go,” I said to him. “You can go too,” I said to the nurse.\n“What is your name?”\n\n“Mrs. Walker.”\n\n“You can go, Mrs. Walker. I think I will go to sleep.”\n\nI was alone in the room. It was cool and did not smell like a hospital.\nThe mattress was firm and comfortable and I lay without moving, hardly\nbreathing, happy in feeling the pain lessen. After a while I wanted a\ndrink of water and found the bell on a cord by the bed and rang it but\nnobody came. I went to sleep."}
{"text": "When I woke I looked around. There was sunlight coming in through the\nshutters. I saw the big armoire, the bare walls, and two chairs. My legs\nin the dirty bandages, stuck straight out in the bed. I was careful not\nto move them. I was thirsty and I reached for the bell and pushed the\nbutton. I heard the door open and looked and it was a nurse. She looked\nyoung and pretty.\n\n“Good-morning,” I said.\n\n“Good-morning,” she said and came over to the bed. “We haven’t been able\nto get the doctor. He’s gone to Lake Como. No one knew there was a\npatient coming. What’s wrong with you anyway?”\n\n“I’m wounded. In the legs and feet and my head is hurt.”\n\n“What’s your name?”\n\n“Henry. Frederic Henry.”\n\n“I’ll wash you up. But we can’t do anything to the dressings until the\ndoctor comes.”\n\n“Is Miss Barkley here?”\n\n“No. There’s no one by that name here.”\n\n“Who was the woman who cried when I came in?”\n\nThe nurse laughed. “That’s Mrs. Walker. She was on night duty and she’d\nbeen asleep. She wasn’t expecting any one.”\n\nWhile we were talking she was undressing me, and when I was undressed,\nexcept for the bandages, she washed me, very gently and smoothly. The\nwashing felt very good. There was a bandage on my head but she washed\nall around the edge.\n\n“Where were you wounded?”\n\n“On the Isonzo north of Plava.”\n\n“Where is that?”\n\n“North of Gorizia.”\n\nI could see that none of the places meant anything to her.\n\n“Do you have a lot of pain?”\n\n“No. Not much now.”\n\nShe put a thermometer in my mouth.\n\n“The Italians put it under the arm,” I said.\n\n“Don’t talk.”\n\nWhen she took the thermometer out she read it and then shook it.\n\n“What’s the temperature?”\n\n“You’re not supposed to know that.”\n\n“Tell me what it is.”\n\n“It’s almost normal.”\n\n“I never have any fever. My legs are full of old iron too.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“They’re full of trench-mortar fragments, old screws and bed-springs and\nthings.”\n\nShe shook her head and smiled.\n\n“If you had any foreign bodies in your legs they would set up an\ninflammation and you’d have fever.”\n\n“All right,” I said. “We’ll see what comes out.”\n\nShe went out of the room and came back with the old nurse of the early\nmorning. Together they made the bed with me in it. That was new to me\nand an admirable proceeding.\n\n“Who is in charge here?”\n\n“Miss Van Campen.”\n\n“How many nurses are there?”\n\n“Just us two.”\n\n“Won’t there be more?”\n\n“Some more are coming.”\n\n“When will they get here?”\n\n“I don’t know. You ask a great many questions for a sick boy.”\n\n“I’m not sick,” I said, “I’m wounded.”\n\nThey had finished making the bed and I lay with a clean smooth sheet\nunder me and another sheet over me. Mrs. Walker went out and came back\nwith a pajama jacket. They put that on me and I felt very clean and\ndressed.\n\n“You’re awfully nice to me,” I said. The nurse called Miss Gage giggled.\n“Could I have a drink of water?” I asked.\n\n“Certainly. Then you can have breakfast.”\n\n“I don’t want breakfast. Can I have the shutters opened please?”\n\nThe light had been dim in the room and when the shutters were opened it\nwas bright sunlight and I looked out on a balcony and beyond were the\ntile roofs of houses and chimneys. I looked out over the tiled roofs and\nsaw white clouds and the sky very blue.\n\n“Don’t you know when the other nurses are coming?”\n\n“Why? Don’t we take good care of you?”\n\n“You’re very nice.”\n\n“Would you like to use the bedpan?”\n\n“I might try.”\n\nThey helped me and held me up but it was not any use. Afterward I lay\nand looked out the open doors onto the balcony.\n\n“When does the doctor come?”\n\n“When he gets back. We’ve tried to telephone to Lake Como for him.”\n\n“Aren’t there any other doctors?”\n\n“He’s the doctor for the hospital.”\n\nMiss Gage brought a pitcher of water and a glass. I drank three glasses\nand then they left me and I looked out the window a while and went back\nto sleep. I ate some lunch and in the afternoon Miss Van Campen, the\nsuperintendent, came up to see me. She did not like me and I did not\nlike her. She was small and neatly suspicious and too good for her\nposition. She asked many questions and seemed to think it was somewhat\ndisgraceful that I was with the Italians.\n\n“Can I have wine with the meals?” I asked her.\n\n“Only if the doctor prescribes it.”\n\n“I can’t have it until he comes?”\n\n“Absolutely not.”\n\n“You plan on having him come eventually?”"}
{"text": "“We’ve telephoned him at Lake Como.”\n\nShe went out and Miss Gage came back.\n\n“Why were you rude to Miss Van Campen?” she asked after she had done\nsomething for me very skilfully.\n\n“I didn’t mean to be. But she was snooty.”\n\n“She said you were domineering and rude.”\n\n“I wasn’t. But what’s the idea of a hospital without a doctor?”\n\n“He’s coming. They’ve telephoned for him to Lake Como.”\n\n“What does he do there? Swim?”\n\n“No. He has a clinic there.”\n\n“Why don’t they get another doctor?”\n\n“Hush. Hush. Be a good boy and he’ll come.”\n\nI sent for the porter and when he came I told him in Italian to get me a\nbottle of Cinzano at the wine shop, a fiasco of chianti and the evening\npapers. He went away and brought them wrapped in newspaper, unwrapped\nthem and, when I asked him to, drew the corks and put the wine and\nvermouth under the bed. They left me alone and I lay in bed and read the\npapers awhile, the news from the front, and the list of dead officers\nwith their decorations and then reached down and brought up the bottle\nof Cinzano and held it straight up on my stomach, the cool glass against\nmy stomach, and took little drinks making rings on my stomach from\nholding the bottle there between drinks, and watched it get dark outside\nover the roofs of the town. The swallows circled around and I watched\nthem and the night-hawks flying above the roofs and drank the Cinzano.\nMiss Gage brought up a glass with some egg-nog in it. I lowered the\nvermouth bottle to the other side of the bed when she came in.\n\n“Miss Van Campen had some sherry put in this,” she said. “You shouldn’t\nbe rude to her. She’s not young and this hospital is a big\nresponsibility for her. Mrs. Walker’s too old and she’s no use to her.”\n\n“She’s a splendid woman,” I said. “Thank her very much.”\n\n“I’m going to bring your supper right away.”\n\n“That’s all right,” I said. “I’m not hungry.”\n\nWhen she brought the tray and put it on the bed table I thanked her and\nate a little of the supper. Afterward it was dark outside and I could\nsee the beams of the search-lights moving in the sky. I watched for a\nwhile and then went to sleep. I slept heavily except once I woke\nsweating and scared and then went back to sleep trying to stay outside\nof my dream. I woke for good long before it was light and heard roosters\ncrowing and stayed on awake until it began to be light. I was tired and\nonce it was really light I went back to sleep again.\n\nIt was bright sunlight in the room when I woke. I thought I was back at\nthe front and stretched out in bed. My legs hurt me and I looked down at\nthem still in the dirty bandages, and seeing them knew where I was. I\nreached up for the bell-cord and pushed the button. I heard it buzz down\nthe hall and then some one coming on rubber soles along the hall. It was\nMiss Gage and she looked a little older in the bright sunlight and not\nso pretty.\n\n“Good-morning,” she said. “Did you have a good night?”\n\n“Yes. Thanks very much,” I said. “Can I have a barber?”\n\n“I came in to see you and you were asleep with this in the bed with\nyou.”\n\nShe opened the armoire door and held up the vermouth bottle. It was\nnearly empty. “I put the other bottle from under the bed in there too,”\nshe said. “Why didn’t you ask me for a glass?”\n\n“I thought maybe you wouldn’t let me have it.”\n\n“I’d have had some with you.”\n\n“You’re a fine girl.”\n\n“It isn’t good for you to drink alone,” she said. “You mustn’t do it.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Your friend Miss Barkley’s come,” she said.\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Yes. I don’t like her.”\n\n“You will like her. She’s awfully nice.”\n\nShe shook her head. “I’m sure she’s fine. Can you move just a little to\nthis side? That’s fine. I’ll clean you up for breakfast.” She washed me\nwith a cloth and soap and warm water. “Hold your shoulder up,” she said.\n“That’s fine.”\n\n“Can I have the barber before breakfast?”\n\n“I’ll send the porter for him.” She went out and came back. “He’s gone\nfor him,” she said and dipped the cloth she held in the basin of water.\n\nThe barber came with the porter. He was a man of about fifty with an\nupturned mustache. Miss Gage was finished with me and went out and the\nbarber lathered my face and shaved. He was very solemn and refrained\nfrom talking."}
{"text": "“What’s the matter? Don’t you know any news?” I asked.\n\n“What news?”\n\n“Any news. What’s happened in the town?”\n\n“It is time of war,” he said. “The enemy’s ears are everywhere.”\n\nI looked up at him. “Please hold your face still,” he said and went on\nshaving. “I will tell nothing.”\n\n“What’s the matter with you?” I asked.\n\n“I am an Italian. I will not communicate with the enemy.”\n\nI let it go at that. If he was crazy, the sooner I could get out from\nunder the razor the better. Once I tried to get a good look at him.\n“Beware,” he said. “The razor is sharp.”\n\nI paid him when it was over and tipped him half a lira. He returned the\ncoins.\n\n“I will not. I am not at the front. But I am an Italian.”\n\n“Get the hell out of here.”\n\n“With your permission,” he said and wrapped his razors in newspaper. He\nwent out leaving the five copper coins on the table beside the bed. I\nrang the bell. Miss Gage came in. “Would you ask the porter to come\nplease?”\n\n“All right.”\n\nThe porter came in. He was trying to keep from laughing.\n\n“Is that barber crazy?”\n\n“No, signorino. He made a mistake. He doesn’t understand very well and\nhe thought I said you were an Austrian officer.”\n\n“Oh,” I said.\n\n“Ho ho ho,” the porter laughed. “He was funny. One move from you he said\nand he would have—” he drew his forefinger across his throat.\n\n“Ho ho ho,” he tried to keep from laughing. “When I tell him you were\nnot an Austrian. Ho ho ho.”\n\n“Ho ho ho,” I said bitterly. “How funny if he would cut my throat. Ho ho\nho.”\n\n“No, signorino. No, no. He was so frightened of an Austrian. Ho ho ho.”\n\n“Ho ho ho,” I said. “Get out of here.”\n\nHe went out and I heard him laughing in the hall. I heard some one\ncoming down the hallway. I looked toward the door. It was Catherine\nBarkley.\n\nShe came in the room and over to the bed.\n\n“Hello, darling,” she said. She looked fresh and young and very\nbeautiful. I thought I had never seen any one so beautiful.\n\n“Hello,” I said. When I saw her I was in love with her. Everything\nturned over inside of me. She looked toward the door, saw there was no\none, then she sat on the side of the bed and leaned over and kissed me.\nI pulled her down and kissed her and felt her heart beating.\n\n“You sweet,” I said. “Weren’t you wonderful to come here?”\n\n“It wasn’t very hard. It may be hard to stay.”\n\n“You’ve got to stay,” I said. “Oh, you’re wonderful.” I was crazy about\nher. I could not believe she was really there and held her tight to me.\n\n“You mustn’t,” she said. “You’re not well enough.”\n\n“Yes, I am. Come on.”\n\n“No. You’re not strong enough.”\n\n“Yes. I am. Yes. Please.”\n\n“You do love me?”\n\n“I really love you. I’m crazy about you. Come on please.”\n\n“Feel our hearts beating.”\n\n“I don’t care about our hearts. I want you. I’m just mad about you.”\n\n“You really love me?”\n\n“Don’t keep on saying that. Come on. Please. Please, Catherine.”\n\n“All right but only for a minute.”\n\n“All right,” I said. “Shut the door.”\n\n“You can’t. You shouldn’t.”\n\n“Come on. Don’t talk. Please come on.”\n\nCatherine sat in a chair by the bed. The door was open into the hall.\nThe wildness was gone and I felt finer than I had ever felt.\n\nShe asked, “Now do you believe I love you?”\n\n“Oh, you’re lovely,” I said. “You’ve got to stay. They can’t send you\naway. I’m crazy in love with you.”\n\n“We’ll have to be awfully careful. That was just madness. We can’t do\nthat.”\n\n“We can at night.”\n\n“We’ll have to be awfully careful. You’ll have to be careful in front of\nother people.”\n\n“I will.”\n\n“You’ll have to be. You’re sweet. You do love me, don’t you?”\n\n“Don’t say that again. You don’t know what that does to me.”\n\n“I’ll be careful then. I don’t want to do anything more to you. I have\nto go now, darling, really.”\n\n“Come back right away.”\n\n“I’ll come when I can.”\n\n“Good-by.”\n\n“Good-by, sweet.”\n\nShe went out. God knows I had not wanted to fall in love with her. I had\nnot wanted to fall in love with any one. But God knows I had and I lay\non the bed in the room of the hospital in Milan and all sorts of things\nwent through my head but I felt wonderful and finally Miss Gage came in.\n\n“The doctor’s coming,” she said. “He telephoned from Lake Como.”\n\n“When does he get here?”\n\n“He’ll be here this afternoon.”"}
{"text": "Nothing happened until afternoon. The doctor was a thin quiet little man\nwho seemed disturbed by the war. He took out a number of small steel\nsplinters from my thighs with delicate and refined distaste. He used a\nlocal anæsthetic called something or other “snow,” which froze the\ntissue and avoided pain until the probe, the scalpel or the forceps got\nbelow the frozen portion. The anæsthetized area was clearly defined by\nthe patient and after a time the doctor’s fragile delicacy was exhausted\nand he said it would be better to have an X-ray. Probing was\nunsatisfactory, he said.\n\nThe X-ray was taken at the Ospedale Maggiore and the doctor who did it\nwas excitable, efficient and cheerful. It was arranged by holding up the\nshoulders, that the patient should see personally some of the larger\nforeign bodies through the machine. The plates were to be sent over. The\ndoctor requested me to write in his pocket notebook, my name, and\nregiment and some sentiment. He declared that the foreign bodies were\nugly, nasty, brutal. The Austrians were sons of bitches. How many had I\nkilled? I had not killed any but I was anxious to please—and I said I\nhad killed plenty. Miss Gage was with me and the doctor put his arm\naround her and said she was more beautiful than Cleopatra. Did she\nunderstand that? Cleopatra the former queen of Egypt. Yes, by God she\nwas. We returned to the little hospital in the ambulance and after a\nwhile and much lifting I was upstairs and in bed again. The plates came\nthat afternoon, the doctor had said by God he would have them that\nafternoon and he did. Catherine Barkley showed them to me. They were in\nred envelopes and she took them out of the envelopes and held them up to\nthe light and we both looked.\n\n“That’s your right leg,” she said, then put the plate back in the\nenvelope. “This is your left.”\n\n“Put them away,” I said, “and come over to the bed.”\n\n“I can’t,” she said. “I just brought them in for a second to show you.”\n\nShe went out and I lay there. It was a hot afternoon and I was sick of\nlying in bed. I sent the porter for the papers, all the papers he could\nget.\n\nBefore he came back three doctors came into the room. I have noticed\nthat doctors who fail in the practice of medicine have a tendency to\nseek one another’s company and aid in consultation. A doctor who cannot\ntake out your appendix properly will recommend to you a doctor who will\nbe unable to remove your tonsils with success. These were three such\ndoctors.\n\n“This is the young man,” said the house doctor with the delicate hands.\n\n“How do you do?” said the tall gaunt doctor with the beard. The third\ndoctor, who carried the X-ray plates in their red envelopes, said\nnothing.\n\n“Remove the dressings?” questioned the bearded doctor.\n\n“Certainly. Remove the dressings, please, nurse,” the house doctor said\nto Miss Gage. Miss Gage removed the dressings. I looked down at the\nlegs. At the field hospital they had the look of not too freshly ground\nhamburger steak. Now they were crusted and the knee was swollen and\ndiscolored and the calf sunken but there was no pus.\n\n“Very clean,” said the house doctor. “Very clean and nice.”\n\n“Um,” said the doctor with the beard. The third doctor looked over the\nhouse doctor’s shoulder.\n\n“Please move the knee,” said the bearded doctor.\n\n“I can’t.”\n\n“Test the articulation?” the bearded doctor questioned. He had a stripe\nbeside the three stars on his sleeve. That meant he was a first captain.\n\n“Certainly,” the house doctor said. Two of them took hold of my right\nleg very gingerly and bent it.\n\n“That hurts,” I said.\n\n“Yes. Yes. A little further, doctor.”\n\n“That’s enough. That’s as far as it goes,” I said.\n\n“Partial articulation,” said the first captain. He straightened up. “May\nI see the plates again, please, doctor?” The third doctor handed him one\nof the plates. “No. The left leg, please.”\n\n“That is the left leg, doctor.”\n\n“You are right. I was looking from a different angle.” He returned the\nplate. The other plate he examined for some time. “You see, doctor?” he\npointed to one of the foreign bodies which showed spherical and clear\nagainst the light. They examined the plate for some time."}
{"text": "“Only one thing I can say,” the first captain with the beard said. “It\nis a question of time. Three months, six months probably.”\n\n“Certainly the synovial fluid must re-form.”\n\n“Certainly. It is a question of time. I could not conscientiously open a\nknee like that before the projectile was encysted.”\n\n“I agree with you, doctor.”\n\n“Six months for what?” I asked.\n\n“Six months for the projectile to encyst before the knee can be opened\nsafely.”\n\n“I don’t believe it,” I said.\n\n“Do you want to keep your knee, young man?”\n\n“No,” I said.\n\n“What?”\n\n“I want it cut off,” I said, “so I can wear a hook on it.”\n\n“What do you mean? A hook?”\n\n“He is joking,” said the house doctor. He patted my shoulder very\ndelicately. “He wants to keep his knee. This is a very brave young man.\nHe has been proposed for the silver medal of valor.”\n\n“All my felicitations,” said the first captain. He shook my hand. “I can\nonly say that to be on the safe side you should wait at least six months\nbefore opening such a knee. You are welcome of course to another\nopinion.”\n\n“Thank you very much,” I said. “I value your opinion.”\n\nThe first captain looked at his watch.\n\n“We must go,” he said. “All my best wishes.”\n\n“All my best wishes and many thanks,” I said. I shook hands with the\nthird doctor, “Capitano Varini—Tenente Enry,” and they all three went\nout of the room.\n\n“Miss Gage,” I called. She came in. “Please ask the house doctor to come\nback a minute.”\n\nHe came in holding his cap and stood by the bed. “Did you wish to see\nme?”\n\n“Yes. I can’t wait six months to be operated on. My God, doctor, did you\never stay in bed six months?”\n\n“You won’t be in bed all the time. You must first have the wounds\nexposed to the sun. Then afterward you can be on crutches.”\n\n“For six months and then have an operation?”\n\n“That is the safe way. The foreign bodies must be allowed to encyst and\nthe synovial fluid will re-form. Then it will be safe to open up the\nknee.”\n\n“Do you really think yourself I will have to wait that long?”\n\n“That is the safe way.”\n\n“Who is that first captain?”\n\n“He is a very excellent surgeon of Milan.”\n\n“He’s a first captain, isn’t he?”\n\n“Yes, but he is an excellent surgeon.”\n\n“I don’t want my leg fooled with by a first captain. If he was any good\nhe would be made a major. I know what a first captain is, doctor.”\n\n“He is an excellent surgeon and I would rather have his judgment than\nany surgeon I know.”\n\n“Could another surgeon see it?”\n\n“Certainly if you wish. But I would take Dr. Varella’s opinion myself.”\n\n“Could you ask another surgeon to come and see it?”\n\n“I will ask Valentini to come.”\n\n“Who is he?”\n\n“He is a surgeon of the Ospedale Maggiore.”\n\n“Good. I appreciate it very much. You understand, doctor, I couldn’t\nstay in bed six months.”\n\n“You would not be in bed. You would first take a sun cure. Then you\ncould have light exercise. Then when it was encysted we would operate.”\n\n“But I can’t wait six months.”\n\nThe doctor spread his delicate fingers on the cap he held and smiled.\n“You are in such a hurry to get back to the front?”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“It is very beautiful,” he said. “You are a noble young man.” He stooped\nover and kissed me very delicately on the forehead. “I will send for\nValentini. Do not worry and excite yourself. Be a good boy.”\n\n“Will you have a drink?” I asked.\n\n“No thank you. I never drink alcohol.”\n\n“Just have one.” I rang for the porter to bring glasses.\n\n“No. No thank you. They are waiting for me.”\n\n“Good-by,” I said.\n\n“Good-by.”\n\nTwo hours later Dr. Valentini came into the room. He was in a great\nhurry and the points of his mustache stood straight up. He was a major,\nhis face was tanned and he laughed all the time."}
{"text": "“How did you do it, this rotten thing?” he asked. “Let me see the\nplates. Yes. Yes. That’s it. You look healthy as a goat. Who’s the\npretty girl? Is she your girl? I thought so. Isn’t this a bloody war?\nHow does that feel? You are a fine boy. I’ll make you better than new.\nDoes that hurt? You bet it hurts. How they love to hurt you, these\ndoctors. What have they done for you so far? Can’t that girl talk\nItalian? She should learn. What a lovely girl. I could teach her. I will\nbe a patient here myself. No, but I will do all your maternity work\nfree. Does she understand that? She will make you a fine boy. A fine\nblonde like she is. That’s fine. That’s all right. What a lovely girl.\nAsk her if she eats supper with me. No I won’t take her away from you.\nThank you. Thank you very much, Miss. That’s all.”\n\n“That’s all I want to know.” He patted me on the shoulder. “Leave the\ndressings off.”\n\n“Will you have a drink, Dr. Valentini?”\n\n“A drink? Certainly. I will have ten drinks. Where are they?”\n\n“In the armoire. Miss Barkley will get the bottle.”\n\n“Cheery oh. Cheery oh to you, Miss. What a lovely girl. I will bring you\nbetter cognac than that.” He wiped his mustache.\n\n“When do you think it can be operated on?”\n\n“To-morrow morning. Not before. Your stomach must be emptied. You must\nbe washed out. I will see the old lady downstairs and leave\ninstructions. Good-by. I see you to-morrow. I’ll bring you better cognac\nthan that. You are very comfortable here. Good-by. Until to-morrow. Get\na good sleep. I’ll see you early.” He waved from the doorway, his\nmustaches went straight up, his brown face was smiling. There was a star\nin a box on his sleeve because he was a major.\n\nThat night a bat flew into the room through the open door that led onto\nthe balcony and through which we watched the night over the roofs of the\ntown. It was dark in our room except for the small light of the night\nover the town and the bat was not frightened but hunted in the room as\nthough he had been outside. We lay and watched him and I do not think he\nsaw us because we lay so still. After he went out we saw a searchlight\ncome on and watched the beam move across the sky and then go off and it\nwas dark again. A breeze came in the night and we heard the men of the\nanti-aircraft gun on the next roof talking. It was cool and they were\nputting on their capes. I worried in the night about some one coming up\nbut Catherine said they were all asleep. Once in the night we went to\nsleep and when I woke she was not there but I heard her coming along the\nhall and the door opened and she came back to the bed and said it was\nall right she had been downstairs and they were all asleep. She had been\noutside Miss Van Campen’s door and heard her breathing in her sleep. She\nbrought crackers and we ate them and drank some vermouth. We were very\nhungry but she said that would all have to be gotten out of me in the\nmorning. I went to sleep again in the morning when it was light and when\nI was awake I found she was gone again. She came in looking fresh and\nlovely and sat on the bed and the sun rose while I had the thermometer\nin my mouth and we smelled the dew on the roofs and then the coffee of\nthe men at the gun on the next roof.\n\n“I wish we could go for a walk,” Catherine said. “I’d wheel you if we\nhad a chair.”\n\n“How would I get into the chair?”\n\n“We’d do it.”\n\n“We could go out to the park and have breakfast outdoors.” I looked out\nthe open doorway.\n\n“What we’ll really do,” she said, “is get you ready for your friend Dr.\nValentini.”\n\n“I thought he was grand.”\n\n“I didn’t like him as much as you did. But I imagine he’s very good.”\n\n“Come back to bed, Catherine. Please,” I said.\n\n“I can’t. Didn’t we have a lovely night?”\n\n“And can you be on night duty to-night?”\n\n“I probably will. But you won’t want me.”\n\n“Yes, I will.”\n\n“No, you won’t. You’ve never been operated on. You don’t know how you’ll\nbe.”\n\n“I’ll be all right.”\n\n“You’ll be sick and I won’t be anything to you.”\n\n“Come back then now.”\n\n“No,” she said. “I have to do the chart, darling, and fix you up.”\n\n“You don’t really love me or you’d come back again.”"}
{"text": "“You’re such a silly boy.” She kissed me. “That’s all right for the\nchart. Your temperature’s always normal. You’ve such a lovely\ntemperature.”\n\n“You’ve got a lovely everything.”\n\n“Oh no. You have the lovely temperature. I’m awfully proud of your\ntemperature.”\n\n“Maybe all our children will have fine temperatures.”\n\n“Our children will probably have beastly temperatures.”\n\n“What do you have to do to get me ready for Valentini?”\n\n“Not much. But quite unpleasant.”\n\n“I wish you didn’t have to do it.”\n\n“I don’t. I don’t want any one else to touch you. I’m silly. I get\nfurious if they touch you.”\n\n“Even Ferguson?”\n\n“Especially Ferguson and Gage and the other, what’s her name?”\n\n“Walker?”\n\n“That’s it. They’ve too many nurses here now. There must be some more\npatients or they’ll send us away. They have four nurses now.”\n\n“Perhaps there’ll be some. They need that many nurses. It’s quite a big\nhospital.”\n\n“I hope some will come. What would I do if they sent me away? They will\nunless there are more patients.”\n\n“I’d go too.”\n\n“Don’t be silly. You can’t go yet. But get well quickly, darling, and we\nwill go somewhere.”\n\n“And then what?”\n\n“Maybe the war will be over. It can’t always go on.”\n\n“I’ll get well,” I said. “Valentini will fix me.”\n\n“He should with those mustaches. And, darling, when you’re going under\nthe ether just think about something else—not us. Because people get\nvery blabby under an anæsthetic.”\n\n“What should I think about?”\n\n“Anything. Anything but us. Think about your people. Or even any other\ngirl.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Say your prayers then. That ought to create a splendid impression.”\n\n“Maybe I won’t talk.”\n\n“That’s true. Often people don’t talk.”\n\n“I won’t talk.”\n\n“Don’t brag, darling. Please don’t brag. You’re so sweet and you don’t\nhave to brag.”\n\n“I won’t talk a word.”\n\n“Now you’re bragging, darling. You know you don’t need to brag. Just\nstart your prayers or poetry or something when they tell you to breathe\ndeeply. You’ll be lovely that way and I’ll be so proud of you. I’m very\nproud of you anyway. You have such a lovely temperature and you sleep\nlike a little boy with your arm around the pillow and think it’s me. Or\nis it some other girl? Some fine Italian girl?”\n\n“It’s you.”\n\n“Of course it’s me. Oh I do love you and Valentini will make you a fine\nleg. I’m glad I don’t have to watch it.”\n\n“And you’ll be on night duty to-night.”\n\n“Yes. But you won’t care.”\n\n“You wait and see.”\n\n“There, darling. Now you’re all clean inside and out. Tell me. How many\npeople have you ever loved?”\n\n“Nobody.”\n\n“Not me even?”\n\n“Yes, you.”\n\n“How many others really?”\n\n“None.”\n\n“How many have you—how do you say it?—stayed with?”\n\n“None.”\n\n“You’re lying to me.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It’s all right. Keep right on lying to me. That’s what I want you to\ndo. Were they pretty?”\n\n“I never stayed with any one.”\n\n“That’s right. Were they very attractive?”\n\n“I don’t know anything about it.”\n\n“You’re just mine. That’s true and you’ve never belonged to any one\nelse. But I don’t care if you have. I’m not afraid of them. But don’t\ntell me about them. When a man stays with a girl when does she say how\nmuch it costs?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Of course not. Does she say she loves him? Tell me that. I want to know\nthat.”\n\n“Yes. If he wants her to.”\n\n“Does he say he loves her? Tell me please. It’s important.”\n\n“He does if he wants to.”\n\n“But you never did? Really?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Not really. Tell me the truth?”\n\n“No,” I lied.\n\n“You wouldn’t,” she said. “I knew you wouldn’t. Oh, I love you,\ndarling.”\n\nOutside the sun was up over the roofs and I could see the points of the\ncathedral with the sunlight on them. I was clean inside and outside and\nwaiting for the doctor.\n\n“And that’s it?” Catherine said. “She says just what he wants her to?”\n\n“Not always.”\n\n“But I will. I’ll say just what you wish and I’ll do what you wish and\nthen you will never want any other girls, will you?” She looked at me\nvery happily. “I’ll do what you want and say what you want and then I’ll\nbe a great success, won’t I?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What would you like me to do now that you’re all ready?”\n\n“Come to the bed again.”\n\n“All right. I’ll come.”\n\n“Oh, darling, darling, darling,” I said.\n\n“You see,” she said. “I do anything you want.”\n\n“You’re so lovely.”\n\n“I’m afraid I’m not very good at it yet.”\n\n“You’re lovely.”"}
{"text": "“I want what you want. There isn’t any me any more. Just what you want.”\n\n“You sweet.”\n\n“I’m good. Aren’t I good? You don’t want any other girls, do you?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You see? I’m good. I do what you want.”\n\nWhen I was awake after the operation I had not been away. You do not go\naway. They only choke you. It is not like dying it is just a chemical\nchoking so you do not feel, and afterward you might as well have been\ndrunk except that when you throw up nothing comes but bile and you do\nnot feel better afterward. I saw sandbags at the end of the bed. They\nwere on pipes that came out of the cast. After a while I saw Miss Gage\nand she said, “How is it now?”\n\n“Better,” I said.\n\n“He did a wonderful job on your knee.”\n\n“How long did it take?”\n\n“Two hours and a half.”\n\n“Did I say anything silly?”\n\n“Not a thing. Don’t talk. Just be quiet.”\n\nI was sick and Catherine was right. It did not make any difference who\nwas on night duty.\n\nThere were three other patients in the hospital now, a thin boy in the\nRed Cross from Georgia with malaria, a nice boy, also thin, from New\nYork, with malaria and jaundice, and a fine boy who had tried to unscrew\nthe fuse-cap from a combination shrapnel and high explosive shell for a\nsouvenir. This was a shrapnel shell used by the Austrians in the\nmountains with a nose-cap which went on after the burst and exploded on\ncontact.\n\nCatherine Barkley was greatly liked by the nurses because she would do\nnight duty indefinitely. She had quite a little work with the malaria\npeople, the boy who had unscrewed the nose-cap was a friend of ours and\nnever rang at night, unless it was necessary but between the times of\nworking we were together. I loved her very much and she loved me. I\nslept in the daytime and we wrote notes during the day when we were\nawake and sent them by Ferguson. Ferguson was a fine girl. I never\nlearned anything about her except that she had a brother in the\nFifty-Second Division and a brother in Mesopotamia and she was very good\nto Catherine Barkley.\n\n“Will you come to our wedding, Fergy?” I said to her once.\n\n“You’ll never get married.”\n\n“We will.”\n\n“No you won’t.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“You’ll fight before you’ll marry.”\n\n“We never fight.”\n\n“You’ve time yet.”\n\n“We don’t fight.”\n\n“You’ll die then. Fight or die. That’s what people do. They don’t\nmarry.”\n\nI reached for her hand. “Don’t take hold of me,” she said. “I’m not\ncrying. Maybe you’ll be all right you two. But watch out you don’t get\nher in trouble. You get her in trouble and I’ll kill you.”\n\n“I won’t get her in trouble.”\n\n“Well watch out then. I hope you’ll be all right. You have a good time.”\n\n“We have a fine time.”\n\n“Don’t fight then and don’t get her into trouble.”\n\n“I won’t.”\n\n“Mind you watch out. I don’t want her with any of these war babies.”\n\n“You’re a fine girl, Fergy.”\n\n“I’m not. Don’t try to flatter me. How does your leg feel?”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“How is your head?” She touched the top of it with her fingers. It was\nsensitive like a foot that had gone to sleep. “It’s never bothered me.”\n\n“A bump like that could make you crazy. It never bothers you?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You’re a lucky young man. Have you the letter done? I’m going down.”\n\n“It’s here,” I said.\n\n“You ought to ask her not to do night duty for a while. She’s getting\nvery tired.”\n\n“All right. I will.”\n\n“I want to do it but she won’t let me. The others are glad to let her\nhave it. You might give her just a little rest.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Miss Van Campen spoke about you sleeping all the forenoons.”\n\n“She would.”\n\n“It would be better if you let her stay off nights a little while.”\n\n“I want her to.”\n\n“You do not. But if you would make her I’d respect you for it.”\n\n“I’ll make her.”\n\n“I don’t believe it.” She took the note and went out. I rang the bell\nand in a little while Miss Gage came in.\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“I just wanted to talk to you. Don’t you think Miss Barkley ought to go\noff night duty for a while? She looks awfully tired. Why does she stay\non so long?”\n\nMiss Gage looked at me.\n\n“I’m a friend of yours,” she said. “You don’t have to talk to me like\nthat.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Don’t be silly. Was that all you wanted?”\n\n“Do you want a vermouth?”\n\n“All right. Then I have to go.” She got out the bottle from the armoire\nand brought a glass."}
{"text": "“You take the glass,” I said. “I’ll drink out of the bottle.”\n\n“Here’s to you,” said Miss Gage.\n\n“What did Van Campen say about me sleeping late in the mornings?”\n\n“She just jawed about it. She calls you our privileged patient.”\n\n“To hell with her.”\n\n“She isn’t mean,” Miss Gage said. “She’s just old and cranky. She never\nliked you.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Well, I do. And I’m your friend. Don’t forget that.”\n\n“You’re awfully damned nice.”\n\n“No. I know who you think is nice. But I’m your friend. How does your\nleg feel?”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“I’ll bring some cold mineral water to pour over it. It must itch under\nthe cast. It’s hot outside.”\n\n“You’re awful nice.”\n\n“Does it itch much?”\n\n“No. It’s fine.”\n\n“I’ll fix those sandbags better.” She leaned over. “I’m your friend.”\n\n“I know you are.”\n\n“No you don’t. But you will some day.”\n\nCatherine Barkley took three nights off night duty and then she came\nback on again. It was as though we met again after each of us had been\naway on a long journey.\n\nWe had a lovely time that summer. When I could go out we rode in a\ncarriage in the park. I remember the carriage, the horse going slowly,\nand up ahead the back of the driver with his varnished high hat, and\nCatherine Barkley sitting beside me. If we let our hands touch, just the\nside of my hand touching hers, we were excited. Afterward when I could\nget around on crutches we went to dinner at Biffi’s or the Gran Italia\nand sat at the tables outside on the floor of the galleria. The waiters\ncame in and out and there were people going by and candles with shades\non the tablecloths and after we decided that we liked the Gran Italia\nbest, George, the head-waiter, saved us a table. He was a fine waiter\nand we let him order the meal while we looked at the people, and the\ngreat galleria in the dusk, and each other. We drank dry white capri\niced in a bucket; although we tried many of the other wines, fresa,\nbarbera and the sweet white wines. They had no wine waiter because of\nthe war and George would smile ashamedly when I asked about wines like\nfresa.\n\n“If you imagine a country that makes a wine because it tastes like\nstrawberries,” he said.\n\n“Why shouldn’t it?” Catherine asked. “It sounds splendid.”\n\n“You try it, lady,” said George, “if you want to. But let me bring a\nlittle bottle of margaux for the Tenente.”\n\n“I’ll try it too, George.”\n\n“Sir, I can’t recommend you to. It doesn’t even taste like\nstrawberries.”\n\n“It might,” said Catherine. “It would be wonderful if it did.”\n\n“I’ll bring it,” said George, “and when the Lady is satisfied I’ll take\nit away.”\n\nIt was not much of a wine. As he said, it did not even taste like\nstrawberries. We went back to capri. One evening I was short of money\nand George loaned me a hundred lire. “That’s all right, Tenente,” he\nsaid. “I know how it is. I know how a man gets short. If you or the lady\nneed money I’ve always got money.”"}
{"text": "After dinner we walked through the galleria, past the other restaurants\nand the shops with their steel shutters down, and stopped at the little\nplace where they sold sandwiches; ham and lettuce sandwiches and anchovy\nsandwiches made of very tiny brown glazed rolls and only about as long\nas your finger. They were to eat in the night when we were hungry. Then\nwe got into an open carriage outside the galleria in front of the\ncathedral and rode to the hospital. At the door of the hospital the\nporter came out to help with the crutches. I paid the driver, and then\nwe rode upstairs in the elevator. Catherine got off at the lower floor\nwhere the nurses lived and I went on up and went down the hall on\ncrutches to my room; sometimes I undressed and got into bed and\nsometimes I sat out on the balcony with my leg up on another chair and\nwatched the swallows over the roofs and waited for Catherine. When she\ncame upstairs it was as though she had been away on a long trip and I\nwent along the hall with her on the crutches and carried the basins and\nwaited outside the doors, or went in with her; it depending on whether\nthey were friends of ours or not, and when she had done all there was to\nbe done we sat out on the balcony outside my room. Afterward I went to\nbed and when they were all asleep and she was sure they would not call\nshe came in. I loved to take her hair down and she sat on the bed and\nkept very still, except suddenly she would dip down to kiss me while I\nwas doing it, and I would take out the pins and lay them on the sheet\nand it would be loose and I would watch her while she kept very still\nand then take out the last two pins and it would all come down and she\nwould drop her head and we would both be inside of it, and it was the\nfeeling of inside a tent or behind a falls.\n\nShe had wonderfully beautiful hair and I would lie sometimes and watch\nher twisting it up in the light that came in the open door and it shone\neven in the night as water shines sometimes just before it is really\ndaylight. She had a lovely face and body and lovely smooth skin too. We\nwould be lying together and I would touch her cheeks and her forehead\nand under her eyes and her chin and throat with the tips of my fingers\nand say, “Smooth as piano keys,” and she would stroke my chin with her\nfinger and say, “Smooth as emery paper and very hard on piano keys.”\n\n“Is it rough?”\n\n“No, darling. I was just making fun of you.”\n\nIt was lovely in the nights and if we could only touch each other we\nwere happy. Besides all the big times we had many small ways of making\nlove and we tried putting thoughts in the other one’s head while we were\nin different rooms. It seemed to work sometimes but that was probably\nbecause we were thinking the same thing anyway.\n\nWe said to each other that we were married the first day she had come to\nthe hospital and we counted months from our wedding day. I wanted to be\nreally married but Catherine said that if we were they would send her\naway and if we merely started on the formalities they would watch her\nand would break us up. We would have to be married under Italian law and\nthe formalities were terrific. I wanted us to be married really because\nI worried about having a child if I thought about it, but we pretended\nto ourselves we were married and did not worry much and I suppose I\nenjoyed not being married, really. I know one night we talked about it\nand Catherine said, “But, darling, they’d send me away.”\n\n“Maybe they wouldn’t.”\n\n“They would. They’d send me home and then we would be apart until after\nthe war.”\n\n“I’d come on leave.”\n\n“You couldn’t get to Scotland and back on a leave. Besides, I won’t\nleave you. What good would it do to marry now? We’re really married. I\ncouldn’t be any more married.”\n\n“I only wanted to for you.”\n\n“There isn’t any me. I’m you. Don’t make up a separate me.”\n\n“I thought girls always wanted to be married.”\n\n“They do. But, darling, I am married. I’m married to you. Don’t I make\nyou a good wife?”\n\n“You’re a lovely wife.”\n\n“You see, darling, I had one experience of waiting to be married.”\n\n“I don’t want to hear about it.”"}
{"text": "“You know I don’t love any one but you. You shouldn’t mind because some\none else loved me.”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“You shouldn’t be jealous of some one who’s dead when you have\neverything.”\n\n“No, but I don’t want to hear about it.”\n\n“Poor darling. And I know you’ve been with all kinds of girls and it\ndoesn’t matter to me.”\n\n“Couldn’t we be married privately some way? Then if anything happened to\nme or if you had a child.”\n\n“There’s no way to be married except by church or state. We are married\nprivately. You see, darling, it would mean everything to me if I had any\nreligion. But I haven’t any religion.”\n\n“You gave me the Saint Anthony.”\n\n“That was for luck. Some one gave it to me.”\n\n“Then nothing worries you?”\n\n“Only being sent away from you. You’re my religion. You’re all I’ve\ngot.”\n\n“All right. But I’ll marry you the day you say.”\n\n“Don’t talk as though you had to make an honest woman of me, darling.\nI’m a very honest woman. You can’t be ashamed of something if you’re\nonly happy and proud of it. Aren’t you happy?”\n\n“But you won’t ever leave me for some one else.”\n\n“No, darling. I won’t ever leave you for some one else. I suppose all\nsorts of dreadful things will happen to us. But you don’t have to worry\nabout that.”\n\n“I don’t. But I love you so much and you did love some one else before.”\n\n“And what happened to him?”\n\n“He died.”\n\n“Yes and if he hadn’t I wouldn’t have met you. I’m not unfaithful,\ndarling. I’ve plenty of faults but I’m very faithful. You’ll be sick of\nme I’ll be so faithful.”\n\n“I’ll have to go back to the front pretty soon.”\n\n“We won’t think about that until you go. You see I’m happy, darling, and\nwe have a lovely time. I haven’t been happy for a long time and when I\nmet you perhaps I was nearly crazy. Perhaps I was crazy. But now we’re\nhappy and we love each other. Do let’s please just be happy. You are\nhappy, aren’t you? Is there anything I do you don’t like? Can I do\nanything to please you? Would you like me to take down my hair? Do you\nwant to play?”\n\n“Yes and come to bed.”\n\n“All right. I’ll go and see the patients first.”"}
{"text": "The summer went that way. I do not remember much about the days, except\nthat they were hot and that there were many victories in the papers. I\nwas very healthy and my legs healed quickly so that it was not very long\nafter I was first on crutches before I was through with them and walking\nwith a cane. Then I started treatments at the Ospedale Maggiore for\nbending the knees, mechanical treatments, baking in a box of mirrors\nwith violet rays, massage, and baths. I went over there afternoons and\nafterward stopped at the café and had a drink and read the papers. I did\nnot roam around the town; but wanted to get home to the hospital from\nthe café. All I wanted was to see Catherine. The rest of the time I was\nglad to kill. Mostly I slept in the mornings, and in the afternoons,\nsometimes, I went to the races, and late to the mechano-therapy\ntreatments. Sometimes I stopped in at the Anglo-American Club and sat in\na deep leather-cushioned chair in front of the window and read the\nmagazines. They would not let us go out together when I was off crutches\nbecause it was unseemly for a nurse to be seen unchaperoned with a\npatient who did not look as though he needed attendance, so we were not\ntogether much in the afternoons. Although sometimes we could go out to\ndinner if Ferguson went along. Miss Van Campen had accepted the status\nthat we were great friends because she got a great amount of work out of\nCatherine. She thought Catherine came from very good people and that\nprejudiced her in her favor finally. Miss Van Campen admired family very\nmuch and came from an excellent family herself. The hospital was quite\nbusy, too, and that kept her occupied. It was a hot summer and I knew\nmany people in Milan but always was anxious to get back home to the\nhospital as soon as the afternoon was over. At the front they were\nadvancing on the Carso, they had taken Kuk across from Plava and were\ntaking the Bainsizza plateau. The West front did not sound so good. It\nlooked as though the war were going on for a long time. We were in the\nwar now but I thought it would take a year to get any great amount of\ntroops over and train them for combat. Next year would be a bad year, or\na good year maybe. The Italians were using up an awful amount of men. I\ndid not see how it could go on. Even if they took all the Bainsizza and\nMonte San Gabriele there were plenty of mountains beyond for the\nAustrians. I had seen them. All the highest mountains were beyond. On\nthe Carso they were going forward but there were marshes and swamps down\nby the sea. Napoleon would have whipped the Austrians on the plains. He\nnever would have fought them in the mountains. He would have let them\ncome down and whipped them around Verona. Still nobody was whipping any\none on the Western front. Perhaps wars weren’t won any more. Maybe they\nwent on forever. Maybe it was another Hundred Years’ War. I put the\npaper back on the rack and left the club. I went down the steps\ncarefully and walked up the Via Manzoni. Outside the Gran Hotel I met\nold Meyers and his wife getting out of a carriage. They were coming back\nfrom the races. She was a big-busted woman in black satin. He was short\nand old, with a white mustache and walked flat-footed with a cane.\n\n“How do you do? How do you do?” She shook hands. “Hello,” said Meyers.\n\n“How were the races?”\n\n“Fine. They were just lovely. I had three winners.”\n\n“How did you do?” I asked Meyers.\n\n“All right. I had a winner.”\n\n“I never know how he does,” Mrs. Meyers said. “He never tells me.”\n\n“I do all right,” Meyers said. He was being cordial. “You ought to come\nout.” While he talked you had the impression that he was not looking at\nyou or that he mistook you for some one else.\n\n“I will,” I said.\n\n“I’m coming up to the hospital to see you,” Mrs. Meyers said. “I have\nsome things for my boys. You’re all my boys. You certainly are my dear\nboys.”\n\n“They’ll be glad to see you.”\n\n“Those dear boys. You too. You’re one of my boys.”\n\n“I have to get back,” I said.\n\n“You give my love to all those dear boys. I’ve got lots of things to\nbring. I’ve some fine Marsala and cakes.”"}
{"text": "“Good-by,” I said. “They’ll be awfully glad to see you.”\n\n“Good-by,” said Meyers. “You come around to the galleria. You know where\nmy table is. We’re all there every afternoon.” I went on up the street.\nI wanted to buy something at the Cova to take to Catherine. Inside, at\nthe Cova, I bought a box of chocolate and while the girl wrapped it up I\nwalked over to the bar. There were a couple of British and some\naviators. I had a martini alone, paid for it, picked up the box of\nchocolate at the outside counter and walked on home toward the hospital.\nOutside the little bar up the street from the Scala there were some\npeople I knew, a vice-consul, two fellows who studied singing, and\nEttore Moretti, an Italian from San Francisco who was in the Italian\narmy. I had a drink with them. One of the singers was named Ralph\nSimmons, and he was singing under the name of Enrico DelCredo. I never\nknew how well he could sing but he was always on the point of something\nvery big happening. He was fat and looked shopworn around the nose and\nmouth as though he had hayfever. He had come back from singing in\nPiacenza. He had sung Tosca and it had been wonderful.\n\n“Of course you’ve never heard me sing,” he said.\n\n“When will you sing here?”\n\n“I’ll be at the Scala in the fall.”\n\n“I’ll bet they throw the benches at you,” Ettore said. “Did you hear how\nthey threw the benches at him in Modena?”\n\n“It’s a damned lie.”\n\n“They threw the benches at him,” Ettore said. “I was there. I threw six\nbenches myself.”\n\n“You’re just a wop from Frisco.”\n\n“He can’t pronounce Italian,” Ettore said. “Everywhere he goes they\nthrow the benches at him.”\n\n“Piacenza’s the toughest house to sing in the north of Italy,” the other\ntenor said. “Believe me that’s a tough little house to sing.” This\ntenor’s name was Edgar Saunders, and he sang under the name of Edouardo\nGiovanni.\n\n“I’d like to be there to see them throw the benches at you,” Ettore\nsaid. “You can’t sing Italian.”\n\n“He’s a nut,” said Edgar Saunders. “All he knows how to say is throw\nbenches.”\n\n“That’s all they know how to do when you two sing,” Ettore said. “Then\nwhen you go to America you’ll tell about your triumphs at the Scala.\nThey wouldn’t let you get by the first note at the Scala.”\n\n“I’ll sing at the Scala,” Simmons said. “I’m going to sing Tosca in\nOctober.”\n\n“We’ll go, won’t we, Mac?” Ettore said to the vice-consul. “They’ll need\nsomebody to protect them.”\n\n“Maybe the American army will be there to protect them,” the vice-consul\nsaid. “Do you want another drink, Simmons? You want a drink, Saunders?”\n\n“All right,” said Saunders.\n\n“I hear you’re going to get the silver medal,” Ettore said to me. “What\nkind of citation you going to get?”\n\n“I don’t know. I don’t know I’m going to get it.”\n\n“You’re going to get it. Oh boy, the girls at the Cova will think you’re\nfine then. They’ll all think you killed two hundred Austrians or\ncaptured a whole trench by yourself. Believe me, I got to work for my\ndecorations.”\n\n“How many have you got, Ettore?” asked the vice-consul.\n\n“He’s got everything,” Simmons said. “He’s the boy they’re running the\nwar for.”\n\n“I’ve got the bronze twice and three silver medals,” said Ettore. “But\nthe papers on only one have come through.”\n\n“What’s the matter with the others?” asked Simmons.\n\n“The action wasn’t successful,” said Ettore. “When the action isn’t\nsuccessful they hold up all the medals.”\n\n“How many times have you been wounded, Ettore?”\n\n“Three times bad. I got three wound stripes. See?” He pulled his sleeve\naround. The stripes were parallel silver lines on a black background\nsewed to the cloth of the sleeve about eight inches below the shoulder.\n\n“You got one too,” Ettore said to me. “Believe me they’re fine to have.\nI’d rather have them than medals. Believe me, boy, when you get three\nyou’ve got something. You only get one for a wound that puts you three\nmonths in the hospital.”\n\n“Where were you wounded, Ettore?” asked the vice-consul."}
{"text": "Ettore pulled up his sleeve. “Here,” he showed the deep smooth red scar.\n“Here on my leg. I can’t show you that because I got puttees on; and in\nthe foot. There’s dead bone in my foot that stinks right now. Every\nmorning I take new little pieces out and it stinks all the time.”\n\n“What hit you?” asked Simmons.\n\n“A hand-grenade. One of those potato mashers. It just blew the whole\nside of my foot off. You know those potato mashers?” He turned to me.\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“I saw the son of a bitch throw it,” Ettore said. “It knocked me down\nand I thought I was dead all right but those damn potato mashers haven’t\ngot anything in them. I shot the son of a bitch with my rifle. I always\ncarry a rifle so they can’t tell I’m an officer.”\n\n“How did he look?” asked Simmons.\n\n“That was the only one he had,” Ettore said. “I don’t know why he threw\nit. I guess he always wanted to throw one. He never saw any real\nfighting probably. I shot the son of a bitch all right.”\n\n“How did he look when you shot him?” Simmons asked.\n\n“Hell, how should I know,” said Ettore. “I shot him in the belly. I was\nafraid I’d miss him if I shot him in the head.”\n\n“How long have you been an officer, Ettore?” I asked.\n\n“Two years. I’m going to be a captain. How long have you been a\nlieutenant?”\n\n“Going on three years.”\n\n“You can’t be a captain because you don’t know the Italian language well\nenough,” Ettore said. “You can talk but you can’t read and write well\nenough. You got to have an education to be a captain. Why don’t you go\nin the American army?”\n\n“Maybe I will.”\n\n“I wish to God I could. Oh, boy, how much does a captain get, Mac?”\n\n“I don’t know exactly. Around two hundred and fifty dollars, I think.”\n\n“Jesus Christ what I could do with two hundred and fifty dollars. You\nbetter get in the American army quick, Fred. See if you can’t get me\nin.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“I can command a company in Italian. I could learn it in English easy.”\n\n“You’d be a general,” said Simmons.\n\n“No, I don’t know enough to be a general. A general’s got to know a hell\nof a lot. You guys think there ain’t anything to war. You ain’t got\nbrains enough to be a second-class corporal.”\n\n“Thank God I don’t have to be,” Simmons said.\n\n“Maybe you will if they round up all you slackers. Oh, boy, I’d like to\nhave you two in my platoon. Mac too. I’d make you my orderly, Mac.”\n\n“You’re a great boy, Ettore,” Mac said. “But I’m afraid you’re a\nmilitarist.”\n\n“I’ll be a colonel before the war’s over,” Ettore said.\n\n“If they don’t kill you.”\n\n“They won’t kill me.” He touched the stars at his collar with his thumb\nand forefinger. “See me do that? We always touch our stars if anybody\nmentions getting killed.”\n\n“Let’s go, Sim,” said Saunders standing up.\n\n“All right.”\n\n“So long,” I said. “I have to go too.” It was a quarter to six by the\nclock inside the bar. “Ciaou, Ettore.”\n\n“Ciaou, Fred,” said Ettore. “That’s pretty fine you’re going to get the\nsilver medal.”\n\n“I don’t know I’ll get it.”\n\n“You’ll get it all right, Fred. I heard you were going to get it all\nright.”\n\n“Well, so long,” I said. “Keep out of trouble, Ettore.”\n\n“Don’t worry about me. I don’t drink and I don’t run around. I’m no\nboozer and whorehound. I know what’s good for me.”\n\n“So long,” I said. “I’m glad you’re going to be promoted captain.”\n\n“I don’t have to wait to be promoted. I’m going to be a captain for\nmerit of war. You know. Three stars with the crossed swords and crown\nabove. That’s me.”\n\n“Good luck.”\n\n“Good luck. When you going back to the front?”\n\n“Pretty soon.”\n\n“Well, I’ll see you around.”\n\n“So long.”\n\n“So long. Don’t take any bad nickels.”\n\nI walked on down a back street that led to a cross-cut to the hospital.\nEttore was twenty-three. He had been brought up by an uncle in San\nFrancisco and was visiting his father and mother in Torino when war was\ndeclared. He had a sister, who had been sent to America with him at the\nsame time to live with the uncle, who would graduate from normal school\nthis year. He was a legitimate hero who bored every one he met.\nCatherine could not stand him.\n\n“We have heroes too,” she said. “But usually, darling, they’re much\nquieter.”\n\n“I don’t mind him.”\n\n“I wouldn’t mind him if he wasn’t so conceited and didn’t bore me, and\nbore me, and bore me.”\n\n“He bores me.”"}
{"text": "“You’re sweet to say so, darling. But you don’t need to. You can picture\nhim at the front and you know he’s useful but he’s so much the type of\nboy I don’t care for.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“You’re awfully sweet to know, and I try and like him but he’s a\ndreadful, dreadful boy really.”\n\n“He said this afternoon he was going to be a captain.”\n\n“I’m glad,” said Catherine. “That should please him.”\n\n“Wouldn’t you like me to have some more exalted rank?”\n\n“No, darling. I only want you to have enough rank so that we’re admitted\nto the better restaurants.”\n\n“That’s just the rank I have.”\n\n“You have a splendid rank. I don’t want you to have any more rank. It\nmight go to your head. Oh, darling, I’m awfully glad you’re not\nconceited. I’d have married you even if you were conceited but it’s very\nrestful to have a husband who’s not conceited.”\n\nWe were talking softly out on the balcony. The moon was supposed to rise\nbut there was a mist over the town and it did not come up and in a\nlittle while it started to drizzle and we came in. Outside the mist\nturned to rain and in a little while it was raining hard and we heard it\ndrumming on the roof. I got up and stood at the door to see if it was\nraining in but it wasn’t, so I left the door open.\n\n“Who else did you see?” Catherine asked.\n\n“Mr. and Mrs. Meyers.”\n\n“They’re a strange lot.”\n\n“He’s supposed to have been in the penitentiary at home. They let him\nout to die.”\n\n“And he lived happily in Milan forever after.”\n\n“I don’t know how happily.”\n\n“Happily enough after jail I should think.”\n\n“She’s bringing some things here.”\n\n“She brings splendid things. Were you her dear boy?”\n\n“One of them.”\n\n“You are all her dear boys,” Catherine said. “She prefers the dear boys.\nListen to it rain.”\n\n“It’s raining hard.”\n\n“And you’ll always love me, won’t you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And the rain won’t make any difference?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“That’s good. Because I’m afraid of the rain.”\n\n“Why?” I was sleepy. Outside the rain was falling steadily.\n\n“I don’t know, darling. I’ve always been afraid of the rain.”\n\n“I like it.”\n\n“I like to walk in it. But it’s very hard on loving.”\n\n“I’ll love you always.”\n\n“I’ll love you in the rain and in the snow and in the hail and—what\nelse is there?”\n\n“I don’t know. I guess I’m sleepy.”\n\n“Go to sleep, darling, and I’ll love you no matter how it is.”\n\n“You’re not really afraid of the rain are you?”\n\n“Not when I’m with you.”\n\n“Why are you afraid of it?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Tell me.”\n\n“Don’t make me.”\n\n“Tell me.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Tell me.”\n\n“All right. I’m afraid of the rain because sometimes I see me dead in\nit.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“And sometimes I see you dead in it.”\n\n“That’s more likely.”\n\n“No it’s not, darling. Because I can keep you safe. I know I can. But\nnobody can help themselves.”\n\n“Please stop it. I don’t want you to get Scotch and crazy to-night. We\nwon’t be together much longer.”\n\n“No, but I am Scotch and crazy. But I’ll stop it. It’s all nonsense.”\n\n“Yes it’s all nonsense.”\n\n“It’s all nonsense. It’s only nonsense. I’m not afraid of the rain. I’m\nnot afraid of the rain. Oh, oh, God, I wish I wasn’t.” She was crying. I\ncomforted her and she stopped crying. But outside it kept on raining."}
{"text": "One day in the afternoon we went to the races. Ferguson went too and\nCrowell Rodgers, the boy who had been wounded in the eyes by the\nexplosion of the shell nose-cap. The girls dressed to go after lunch\nwhile Crowell and I sat on the bed in his room and read the past\nperformances of the horses and the predictions in the racing paper.\nCrowell’s head was bandaged and he did not care much about these races\nbut read the racing paper constantly and kept track of all the horses\nfor something to do. He said the horses were a terrible lot but they\nwere all the horses we had. Old Meyers liked him and gave him tips.\nMeyers won on nearly every race but disliked to give tips because it\nbrought down the prices. The racing was very crooked. Men who had been\nruled off the turf everywhere else were racing in Italy. Meyers’\ninformation was good but I hated to ask him because sometimes he did not\nanswer, and always you could see it hurt him to tell you, but he felt\nobligated to tell us for some reason and he hated less to tell Crowell.\nCrowell’s eyes had been hurt, one was hurt badly, and Meyers had trouble\nwith his eyes and so he liked Crowell. Meyers never told his wife what\nhorses he was playing and she won or lost, mostly lost, and talked all\nthe time.\n\nWe four drove out to San Siro in an open carriage. It was a lovely day\nand we drove out through the park and out along the tramway and out of\ntown where the road was dusty. There were villas with iron fences and\nbig overgrown gardens and ditches with water flowing and green vegetable\ngardens with dust on the leaves. We could look across the plain and see\nfarmhouses and the rich green farms with their irrigation ditches and\nthe mountains to the north. There were many carriages going into the\nrace track and the men at the gate let us in without cards because we\nwere in uniform. We left the carriage, bought programmes, and walked\nacross the infield and then across the smooth thick turf of the course\nto the paddock. The grand stands were old and made of wood and the\nbetting booths were under the stands and in a row out near the stables.\nThere was a crowd of soldiers along the fence in the infield. The\npaddock was fairly well filled with people and they were walking the\nhorses around in a ring under the trees behind the grand-stand. We saw\npeople we knew and got chairs for Ferguson and Catherine and watched the\nhorses.\n\nThey went around, one after the other, their heads down, the grooms\nleading them. One horse, a purplish black, Crowell swore was dyed that\ncolor. We watched him and it seemed possible. He had only come out just\nbefore the bell rang to saddle. We looked him up in the programme from\nthe number on the groom’s arm and it was listed a black gelding named\nJapalac. The race was for horses that had never won a race worth one\nthousand lire or more. Catherine was sure his color had been changed.\nFerguson said she could not tell. I thought he looked suspicious. We all\nagreed we ought to back him and pooled one hundred lire. The odds sheets\nshowed he would pay thirty-five to one. Crowell went over and bought the\ntickets while we watched the jockeys ride around once more and then go\nout under the trees to the track and gallop slowly up to the turn where\nthe start was to be.\n\nWe went up in the grand-stand to watch the race. They had no elastic\nbarrier at San Siro then and the starter lined up all the horses, they\nlooked very small way up the track, and then sent them off with a crack\nof his long whip. They came past us with the black horse well in front\nand on the turn he was running away from the others. I watched them on\nthe far side with the glasses and saw the jockey fighting to hold him in\nbut he could not hold him and when they came around the turn and into\nthe stretch the black horse was fifteen lengths ahead of the others. He\nwent way on up and around the turn after the finish.\n\n“Isn’t it wonderful,” Catherine said. “We’ll have over three thousand\nlire. He must be a splendid horse.”\n\n“I hope his color doesn’t run,” Crowell said, “before they pay off.”"}
{"text": "“He was really a lovely horse,” Catherine said. “I wonder if Mr. Meyers\nbacked him.”\n\n“Did you have the winner?” I called to Meyers. He nodded.\n\n“I didn’t,” Mrs. Meyers said. “Who did you children bet on?”\n\n“Japalac.”\n\n“Really? He’s thirty-five to one!”\n\n“We liked his color.”\n\n“I didn’t. I thought he looked seedy. They told me not to back him.”\n\n“He won’t pay much,” Meyers said.\n\n“He’s marked thirty-five to one in the quotes,” I said.\n\n“He won’t pay much. At the last minute,” Meyers said, “they put a lot of\nmoney on him.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Kempton and the boys. You’ll see. He won’t pay two to one.”\n\n“Then we won’t get three thousand lire,” Catherine said. “I don’t like\nthis crooked racing!”\n\n“We’ll get two hundred lire.”\n\n“That’s nothing. That doesn’t do us any good. I thought we were going to\nget three thousand.”\n\n“It’s crooked and disgusting,” Ferguson said.\n\n“Of course,” said Catherine, “if it hadn’t been crooked we’d never have\nbacked him at all. But I would have liked the three thousand lire.”\n\n“Let’s go down and get a drink and see what they pay,” Crowell said. We\nwent out to where they posted the numbers and the bell rang to pay off\nand they put up 18.50 after Japalac to win. That meant he paid less than\neven money on a ten-lira bet.\n\nWe went to the bar under the grand stand and had a whiskey and soda\napiece. We ran into a couple of Italians we knew and McAdams, the\nvice-consul, and they came up with us when we joined the girls. The\nItalians were full of manners and McAdams talked to Catherine while we\nwent down to bet again. Mr. Meyers was standing near the pari-mutual.\n\n“Ask him what he played,” I said to Crowell.\n\n“What are you on, Mr. Meyers?” Crowell asked. Meyers took out his\nprogramme and pointed to the number five with his pencil.\n\n“Do you mind if we play him too?” Crowell asked.\n\n“Go ahead. Go ahead. But don’t tell my wife I gave it to you.”\n\n“Will you have a drink?” I asked.\n\n“No thanks. I never drink.”\n\nWe put a hundred lire on number five to win and a hundred to place and\nthen had another whiskey and soda apiece. I was feeling very good and we\npicked up a couple more Italians, who each had a drink with us, and went\nback to the girls. These Italians were also very mannered and matched\nmanners with the two we had collected before. In a little while no one\ncould sit down. I gave the tickets to Catherine.\n\n“What horse is it?”\n\n“I don’t know. Mr. Meyers’ choice.”\n\n“Don’t you even know the name?”\n\n“No. You can find it on the programme. Number five I think.”\n\n“You have touching faith,” she said. The number five won but did not pay\nanything. Mr. Meyers was angry.\n\n“You have to put up two hundred lire to make twenty,” he said. “Twelve\nlire for ten. It’s not worth it. My wife lost twenty lire.”\n\n“I’ll go down with you,” Catherine said to me. The Italians all stood\nup. We went downstairs and out to the paddock.\n\n“Do you like this?” Catherine asked.\n\n“Yes. I guess I do.”\n\n“It’s all right, I suppose,” she said. “But, darling, I can’t stand to\nsee so many people.”\n\n“We don’t see many.”\n\n“No. But those Meyers and the man from the bank with his wife and\ndaughters——”\n\n“He cashes my sight drafts,” I said.\n\n“Yes but some one else would if he didn’t. Those last four boys were\nawful.”\n\n“We can stay out here and watch the race from the fence.”\n\n“That will be lovely. And, darling, let’s back a horse we’ve never heard\nof and that Mr. Meyers won’t be backing.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nWe backed a horse named Light For Me that finished fourth in a field of\nfive. We leaned on the fence and watched the horses go by, their hoofs\nthudding as they went past, and saw the mountains off in the distance\nand Milan beyond the trees and the fields.\n\n“I feel so much cleaner,” Catherine said. The horses were coming back,\nthrough the gate, wet and sweating, the jockeys quieting them and riding\nup to dismount under the trees.\n\n“Wouldn’t you like a drink? We could have one out here and see the\nhorses.”\n\n“I’ll get them,” I said.\n\n“The boy will bring them,” Catherine said. She put her hand up and the\nboy came out from the Pagoda bar beside the stables. We sat down at a\nround iron table.\n\n“Don’t you like it better when we’re alone?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\n“I felt very lonely when they were all there.”\n\n“It’s grand here,” I said."}
{"text": "“Yes. It’s really a pretty course.”\n\n“It’s nice.”\n\n“Don’t let me spoil your fun, darling. I’ll go back whenever you want.”\n\n“No,” I said. “We’ll stay here and have our drink. Then we’ll go down\nand stand at the water jump for the steeplechase.”\n\n“You’re awfully good to me,” she said.\n\nAfter we had been alone awhile we were glad to see the others again. We\nhad a good time.\n\nIn September the first cool nights came, then the days were cool and the\nleaves on the trees in the park began to turn color and we knew the\nsummer was gone. The fighting at the front went very badly and they\ncould not take San Gabriele. The fighting on the Bainsizza plateau was\nover and by the middle of the month the fighting for San Gabriele was\nabout over too. They could not take it. Ettore was gone back to the\nfront. The horses were gone to Rome and there was no more racing.\nCrowell had gone to Rome too, to be sent back to America. There were\nriots twice in the town against the war and bad rioting in Turin. A\nBritish major at the club told me the Italians had lost one hundred and\nfifty thousand men on the Bainsizza plateau and on San Gabriele. He said\nthey had lost forty thousand on the Carso besides. We had a drink and he\ntalked. He said the fighting was over for the year down here and that\nthe Italians had bitten off more than they could chew. He said the\noffensive in Flanders was going to the bad. If they killed men as they\ndid this fall the Allies would be cooked in another year. He said we\nwere all cooked but we were all right as long as we did not know it. We\nwere all cooked. The thing was not to recognize it. The last country to\nrealize they were cooked would win the war. We had another drink. Was I\non somebody’s staff? No. He was. It was all balls. We were alone in the\nclub sitting back in one of the big leather sofas. His boots were\nsmoothly polished dull leather. They were beautiful boots. He said it\nwas all balls. They thought only in divisions and man-power. They all\nsquabbled about divisions and only killed them when they got them. They\nwere all cooked. The Germans won the victories. By God they were\nsoldiers. The old Hun was a soldier. But they were cooked too. We were\nall cooked. I asked about Russia. He said they were cooked already. I’d\nsoon see they were cooked. Then the Austrians were cooked too. If they\ngot some Hun divisions they could do it. Did he think they would attack\nthis fall? Of course they would. The Italians were cooked. Everybody\nknew they were cooked. The old Hun would come down through the Trentino\nand cut the railway at Vicenza and then where would the Italians be?\nThey tried that in ’sixteen, I said. Not with Germans. Yes, I said. But\nthey probably wouldn’t do that, he said. It was too simple. They’d try\nsomething complicated and get royally cooked. I had to go, I said. I had\nto get back to the hospital. “Good-by,” he said. Then cheerily, “Every\nsort of luck!” There was a great contrast between his world pessimism\nand personal cheeriness.\n\nI stopped at a barber shop and was shaved and went home to the hospital.\nMy leg was as well as it would get for a long time. I had been up for\nexamination three days before. There were still some treatments to take\nbefore my course at the Ospedale Maggiore was finished and I walked\nalong the side street practising not limping. An old man was cutting\nsilhouettes under an arcade. I stopped to watch him. Two girls were\nposing and he cut their silhouettes together, snipping very fast and\nlooking at them, his head on one side. The girls were giggling. He\nshowed me the silhouettes before he pasted them on white paper and\nhanded them to the girls.\n\n“They’re beautiful,” he said. “How about you, Tenente?”\n\nThe girls went away looking at their silhouettes and laughing. They were\nnice-looking girls. One of them worked in the wine shop across from the\nhospital.\n\n“All right,” I said.\n\n“Take your cap off.”\n\n“No. With it on.”\n\n“It will not be so beautiful,” the old man said. “But,” he brightened,\n“it will be more military.”"}
{"text": "He snipped away at the black paper, then separated the two thicknesses\nand pasted the profiles on a card and handed them to me.\n\n“How much?”\n\n“That’s all right.” He waved his hand. “I just made them for you.”\n\n“Please.” I brought out some coppers. “For pleasure.”\n\n“No. I did them for a pleasure. Give them to your girl.”\n\n“Many thanks until we meet.”\n\n“Until I see thee.”\n\nI went on to the hospital. There were some letters, an official one, and\nsome others. I was to have three weeks’ convalescent leave and then\nreturn to the front. I read it over carefully. Well, that was that. The\nconvalescent leave started October fourth when my course was finished.\nThree weeks was twenty-one days. That made October twenty-fifth. I told\nthem I would not be in and went to the restaurant a little way up the\nstreet from the hospital for supper and read my letters and the\n_Corriere Della Sera_ at the table. There was a letter from my\ngrandfather, containing family news, patriotic encouragement, a draft\nfor two hundred dollars, and a few clippings; a dull letter from the\npriest at our mess, a letter from a man I knew who was flying with the\nFrench and had gotten in with a wild gang and was telling about it, and\na note from Rinaldi asking me how long I was going to skulk in Milano\nand what was all the news? He wanted me to bring him phonograph records\nand enclosed a list. I drank a small bottle of chianti with the meal,\nhad a coffee afterward with a glass of cognac, finished the paper, put\nmy letters in my pocket, left the paper on the table with the tip and\nwent out. In my room at the hospital I undressed, put on pajamas and a\ndressing-gown, pulled down the curtains on the door that opened onto the\nbalcony and sitting up in bed read Boston papers from a pile Mrs. Meyers\nhad left for her boys at the hospital. The Chicago White Sox were\nwinning the American League pennant and the New York Giants were leading\nthe National League. Babe Ruth was a pitcher then playing for Boston.\nThe papers were dull, the news was local and stale, and the war news was\nall old. The American news was all training camps. I was glad I wasn’t\nin a training camp. The baseball news was all I could read and I did not\nhave the slightest interest in it. A number of papers together made it\nimpossible to read with interest. It was not very timely but I read at\nit for a while. I wondered if America really got into the war, if they\nwould close down the major leagues. They probably wouldn’t. There was\nstill racing in Milan and the war could not be much worse. They had\nstopped racing in France. That was where our horse Japalac came from.\nCatherine was not due on duty until nine o’clock. I heard her passing\nalong the floor when she first came on duty and once saw her pass in the\nhall. She went to several other rooms and finally came into mine.\n\n“I’m late, darling,” she said. “There was a lot to do. How are you?”\n\nI told her about my papers and the leave.\n\n“That’s lovely,” she said. “Where do you want to go?”\n\n“Nowhere. I want to stay here.”\n\n“That’s silly. You pick a place to go and I’ll come too.”\n\n“How will you work it?”\n\n“I don’t know. But I will.”\n\n“You’re pretty wonderful.”\n\n“No I’m not. But life isn’t hard to manage when you’ve nothing to lose.”\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\n“Nothing. I was only thinking how small obstacles seemed that once were\nso big.”\n\n“I should think it might be hard to manage.”\n\n“No it won’t, darling. If necessary I’ll simply leave. But it won’t come\nto that.”\n\n“Where should we go?”\n\n“I don’t care. Anywhere you want. Anywhere we don’t know people.”\n\n“Don’t you care where we go?”\n\n“No. I’ll like any place.”\n\nShe seemed upset and taut.\n\n“What’s the matter, Catherine?”\n\n“Nothing. Nothing’s the matter.”\n\n“Yes there is.”\n\n“No nothing. Really nothing.”\n\n“I know there is. Tell me, darling. You can tell me.”\n\n“It’s nothing.”\n\n“Tell me.”\n\n“I don’t want to. I’m afraid I’ll make you unhappy or worry you.”\n\n“No it won’t.”\n\n“You’re sure? It doesn’t worry me but I’m afraid to worry you.”\n\n“It won’t if it doesn’t worry you.”\n\n“I don’t want to tell.”\n\n“Tell it.”\n\n“Do I have to?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I’m going to have a baby, darling. It’s almost three months along.\nYou’re not worried, are you? Please please don’t. You mustn’t worry.”"}
{"text": "“All right.”\n\n“Is it all right?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“I did everything. I took everything but it didn’t make any difference.”\n\n“I’m not worried.”\n\n“I couldn’t help it, darling, and I haven’t worried about it. You\nmustn’t worry or feel badly.”\n\n“I only worry about you.”\n\n“That’s it. That’s what you mustn’t do. People have babies all the time.\nEverybody has babies. It’s a natural thing.”\n\n“You’re pretty wonderful.”\n\n“No I’m not. But you mustn’t mind, darling. I’ll try and not make\ntrouble for you. I know I’ve made trouble now. But haven’t I been a good\ngirl until now? You never knew it, did you?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“It will all be like that. You simply mustn’t worry. I can see you’re\nworrying. Stop it. Stop it right away. Wouldn’t you like a drink,\ndarling? I know a drink always makes you feel cheerful.”\n\n“No. I feel cheerful. And you’re pretty wonderful.”\n\n“No I’m not. But I’ll fix everything to be together if you pick out a\nplace for us to go. It ought to be lovely in October. We’ll have a\nlovely time, darling, and I’ll write you every day while you’re at the\nfront.”\n\n“Where will you be?”\n\n“I don’t know yet. But somewhere splendid. I’ll look after all that.”\n\nWe were quiet awhile and did not talk. Catherine was sitting on the bed\nand I was looking at her but we did not touch each other. We were apart\nas when some one comes into a room and people are self-conscious. She\nput out her hand and took mine.\n\n“You aren’t angry are you, darling?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“And you don’t feel trapped?”\n\n“Maybe a little. But not by you.”\n\n“I didn’t mean by me. You mustn’t be stupid. I meant trapped at all.”\n\n“You always feel trapped biologically.”\n\nShe went away a long way without stirring or removing her hand.\n\n“‘Always’ isn’t a pretty word.”\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\n“It’s all right. But you see I’ve never had a baby and I’ve never even\nloved any one. And I’ve tried to be the way you wanted and then you talk\nabout ‘always.’”\n\n“I could cut off my tongue,” I offered.\n\n“Oh, darling!” she came back from wherever she had been. “You mustn’t\nmind me.” We were both together again and the self-consciousness was\ngone. “We really are the same one and we mustn’t misunderstand on\npurpose.”\n\n“We won’t.”\n\n“But people do. They love each other and they misunderstand on purpose\nand they fight and then suddenly they aren’t the same one.”\n\n“We won’t fight.”\n\n“We mustn’t. Because there’s only us two and in the world there’s all\nthe rest of them. If anything comes between us we’re gone and then they\nhave us.”\n\n“They won’t get us,” I said. “Because you’re too brave. Nothing ever\nhappens to the brave.”\n\n“They die of course.”\n\n“But only once.”\n\n“I don’t know. Who said that?”\n\n“The coward dies a thousand deaths, the brave but one?”\n\n“Of course. Who said it?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“He was probably a coward,” she said. “He knew a great deal about\ncowards but nothing about the brave. The brave dies perhaps two thousand\ndeaths if he’s intelligent. He simply doesn’t mention them.”\n\n“I don’t know. It’s hard to see inside the head of the brave.”\n\n“Yes. That’s how they keep that way.”\n\n“You’re an authority.”\n\n“You’re right, darling. That was deserved.”\n\n“You’re brave.”\n\n“No,” she said. “But I would like to be.”\n\n“I’m not,” I said, “I know where I stand. I’ve been out long enough to\nknow. I’m like a ball-player that bats two hundred and thirty and knows\nhe’s no better.”\n\n“What is a ball-player that bats two hundred and thirty? It’s awfully\nimpressive.”\n\n“It’s not. It means a mediocre hitter in baseball.”\n\n“But still a hitter,” she prodded me.\n\n“I guess we’re both conceited,” I said. “But you are brave.”\n\n“No. But I hope to be.”\n\n“We’re both brave,” I said. “And I’m very brave when I’ve had a drink.”\n\n“We’re splendid people,” Catherine said. She went over to the armoire\nand brought me the cognac and a glass. “Have a drink, darling,” she\nsaid. “You’ve been awfully good.”\n\n“I don’t really want one.”\n\n“Take one.”\n\n“All right.” I poured the water glass a third full of cognac and drank\nit off.\n\n“That was very big,” she said. “I know brandy is for heroes. But you\nshouldn’t exaggerate.”\n\n“Where will we live after the war?”\n\n“In an old people’s home probably,” she said. “For three years I looked\nforward very childishly to the war ending at Christmas. But now I look\nforward till when our son will be a lieutenant commander.”\n\n“Maybe he’ll be a general.”"}
{"text": "“If it’s an hundred years’ war he’ll have time to try both of the\nservices.”\n\n“Don’t you want a drink?”\n\n“No. It always makes you happy, darling, and it only makes me dizzy.”\n\n“Didn’t you ever drink brandy?”\n\n“No, darling. I’m a very old-fashioned wife.”\n\nI reached down to the floor for the bottle and poured another drink.\n\n“I’d better go to have a look at your compatriots,” Catherine said.\n“Perhaps you’ll read the papers until I come back.”\n\n“Do you have to go?”\n\n“Now or later.”\n\n“All right. Now.”\n\n“I’ll come back later.”\n\n“I’ll have finished the papers,” I said.\n\nIt turned cold that night and the next day it was raining. Coming home\nfrom the Ospedale Maggiore it rained very hard and I was wet when I came\nin. Up in my room the rain was coming down heavily outside on the\nbalcony, and the wind blew it against the glass doors. I changed my\nclothing and drank some brandy but the brandy did not taste good. I felt\nsick in the night and in the morning after breakfast I was nauseated.\n\n“There is no doubt about it,” the house surgeon said. “Look at the\nwhites of his eyes, Miss.”\n\nMiss Gage looked. They had me look in a glass. The whites of the eyes\nwere yellow and it was the jaundice. I was sick for two weeks with it.\nFor that reason we did not spend a convalescent leave together. We had\nplanned to go to Pallanza on Lago Maggiore. It is nice there in the fall\nwhen the leaves turn. There are walks you can take and you can troll for\ntrout in the lake. It would have been better than Stresa because there\nare fewer people at Pallanza. Stresa is so easy to get to from Milan\nthat there are always people you know. There is a nice village at\nPallanza and you can row out to the islands where the fishermen live and\nthere is a restaurant on the biggest island. But we did not go.\n\nOne day while I was in bed with jaundice Miss Van Campen came in the\nroom, opened the door into the armoire and saw the empty bottles there.\nI had sent a load of them down by the porter and I believe she must have\nseen them going out and come up to find some more. They were mostly\nvermouth bottles, marsala bottles, capri bottles, empty chianti flasks\nand a few cognac bottles. The porter had carried out the large bottles,\nthose that had held vermouth, and the straw-covered chianti flasks, and\nleft the brandy bottles for the last. It was the brandy bottles and a\nbottle shaped like a bear, which had held kümmel, that Miss Van Campen\nfound. The bear-shaped bottle enraged her particularly. She held it up;\nthe bear was sitting up on his haunches with his paws up; there was a\ncork in his glass head and a few sticky crystals at the bottom. I\nlaughed.\n\n“It was kümmel,” I said. “The best kümmel comes in those bear-shaped\nbottles. It comes from Russia.”\n\n“Those are all brandy bottles, aren’t they?” Miss Van Campen asked.\n\n“I can’t see them all,” I said. “But they probably are.”\n\n“How long has this been going on?”\n\n“I bought them and brought them in myself,” I said. “I have had Italian\nofficers visit me frequently and I have kept brandy to offer them.”\n\n“You haven’t been drinking it yourself?” she said.\n\n“I have also drunk it myself.”\n\n“Brandy,” she said. “Eleven empty bottles of brandy and that bear\nliquid.”\n\n“Kümmel.”\n\n“I will send for some one to take them away. Those are all the empty\nbottles you have?”\n\n“For the moment.”\n\n“And I was pitying you having jaundice. Pity is something that is wasted\non you.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“I suppose you can’t be blamed for not wanting to go back to the front.\nBut I should think you would try something more intelligent than\nproducing jaundice with alcoholism.”\n\n“With what?”\n\n“With alcoholism. You heard me say it.” I did not say anything. “Unless\nyou find something else I’m afraid you will have to go back to the front\nwhen you are through with your jaundice. I don’t believe self-inflicted\njaundice entitles you to a convalescent leave.”\n\n“You don’t?”\n\n“I do not.”\n\n“Have you ever had jaundice, Miss Van Campen?”\n\n“No, but I have seen a great deal of it.”\n\n“You noticed how the patients enjoyed it?”\n\n“I suppose it is better than the front.”\n\n“Miss Van Campen,” I said, “did you ever know a man who tried to disable\nhimself by kicking himself in the scrotum?”"}
{"text": "Miss Van Campen ignored the actual question. She had to ignore it or\nleave the room. She was not ready to leave because she had disliked me\nfor a long time and she was now cashing in.\n\n“I have known many men to escape the front through self-inflicted\nwounds.”\n\n“That wasn’t the question. I have seen self-inflicted wounds also. I\nasked you if you had ever known a man who had tried to disable himself\nby kicking himself in the scrotum. Because that is the nearest sensation\nto jaundice and it is a sensation that I believe few women have ever\nexperienced. That was why I asked you if you had ever had the jaundice,\nMiss Van Campen, because—” Miss Van Campen left the room. Later Miss\nGage came in.\n\n“What did you say to Van Campen? She was furious.”\n\n“We were comparing sensations. I was going to suggest that she had never\nexperienced childbirth——”\n\n“You’re a fool,” Gage said. “She’s after your scalp.”\n\n“She has my scalp,” I said. “She’s lost me my leave and she might try\nand get me court-martialled. She’s mean enough.”\n\n“She never liked you,” Gage said. “What’s it about?”\n\n“She says I’ve drunk myself into jaundice so as not to go back to the\nfront.”\n\n“Pooh,” said Gage. “I’ll swear you’ve never taken a drink. Everybody\nwill swear you’ve never taken a drink.”\n\n“She found the bottles.”\n\n“I’ve told you a hundred times to clear out those bottles. Where are\nthey now?”\n\n“In the armoire.”\n\n“Have you a suitcase?”\n\n“No. Put them in that rucksack.”\n\nMiss Gage packed the bottles in the rucksack. “I’ll give them to the\nporter,” she said. She started for the door.\n\n“Just a minute,” Miss Van Campen said. “I’ll take those bottles.” She\nhad the porter with her. “Carry them, please,” she said. “I want to show\nthem to the doctor when I make my report.”\n\nShe went down the hall. The porter carried the sack. He knew what was in\nit.\n\nNothing happened except that I lost my leave.\n\nThe night I was to return to the front I sent the porter down to hold a\nseat for me on the train when it came from Turin. The train was to leave\nat midnight. It was made up at Turin and reached Milan about half-past\nten at night and lay in the station until time to leave. You had to be\nthere when it came in, to get a seat. The porter took a friend with him,\na machine-gunner on leave who worked in a tailor shop, and was sure that\nbetween them they could hold a place. I gave them money for platform\ntickets and had them take my baggage. There was a big rucksack and two\nmusettes.\n\nI said good-by at the hospital at about five o’clock and went out. The\nporter had my baggage in his lodge and I told him I would be at the\nstation a little before midnight. His wife called me “Signorino” and\ncried. She wiped her eyes and shook hands and then cried again. I patted\nher on the back and she cried once more. She had done my mending and was\na very short dumpy, happy-faced woman with white hair. When she cried\nher whole face went to pieces. I went down to the corner where there was\na wine shop and waited inside looking out the window. It was dark\noutside and cold and misty. I paid for my coffee and grappa and I\nwatched the people going by in the light from the window. I saw\nCatherine and knocked on the window. She looked, saw me and smiled, and\nI went out to meet her. She was wearing a dark blue cape and a soft felt\nhat. We walked along together, along the sidewalk past the wine shops,\nthen across the market square and up the street and through the archway\nto the cathedral square. There were street-car tracks and beyond them\nwas the cathedral. It was white and wet in the mist. We crossed the tram\ntracks. On our left were the shops, their windows lighted, and the\nentrance to the galleria. There was a fog in the square and when we came\nclose to the front of the cathedral it was very big and the stone was\nwet.\n\n“Would you like to go in?”\n\n“No,” Catherine said. We walked along. There was a soldier standing with\nhis girl in the shadow of one of the stone buttresses ahead of us and we\npassed them. They were standing tight up against the stone and he had\nput his cape around her.\n\n“They’re like us,” I said.\n\n“Nobody is like us,” Catherine said. She did not mean it happily."}
{"text": "“I wish they had some place to go.”\n\n“It mightn’t do them any good.”\n\n“I don’t know. Everybody ought to have some place to go.”\n\n“They have the cathedral,” Catherine said. We were past it now. We\ncrossed the far end of the square and looked back at the cathedral. It\nwas fine in the mist. We were standing in front of the leather goods\nshop. There were riding boots, a rucksack and ski boots in the window.\nEach article was set apart as an exhibit; the rucksack in the centre,\nthe riding boots on one side and the ski boots on the other. The leather\nwas dark and oiled smooth as a used saddle. The electric light made high\nlights on the dull oiled leather.\n\n“We’ll ski some time.”\n\n“In two months there will be skiing at Mürren,” Catherine said.\n\n“Let’s go there.”\n\n“All right,” she said. We went on past other windows and turned down a\nside street.\n\n“I’ve never been this way.”\n\n“This is the way I go to the hospital,” I said. It was a narrow street\nand we kept on the right-hand side. There were many people passing in\nthe fog. There were shops and all the windows were lighted. We looked in\na window at a pile of cheeses. I stopped in front of an armorer’s shop.\n\n“Come in a minute. I have to buy a gun.”\n\n“What sort of gun?”\n\n“A pistol.” We went in and I unbuttoned my belt and laid it with the\nempty holster on the counter. Two women were behind the counter. The\nwomen brought out several pistols.\n\n“It must fit this,” I said, opening the holster. It was a gray leather\nholster and I had bought it secondhand to wear in the town.\n\n“Have they good pistols?” Catherine asked.\n\n“They’re all about the same. Can I try this one?” I asked the woman.\n\n“I have no place now to shoot,” she said. “But it is very good. You will\nnot make a mistake with it.”\n\nI snapped it and pulled back the action. The spring was rather strong\nbut it worked smoothly. I sighted it and snapped it again.\n\n“It is used,” the woman said. “It belonged to an officer who was an\nexcellent shot.”\n\n“Did you sell it to him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“How did you get it back?”\n\n“From his orderly.”\n\n“Maybe you have mine,” I said. “How much is this?”\n\n“Fifty lire. It is very cheap.”\n\n“All right. I want two extra clips and a box of cartridges.”\n\nShe brought them from under the counter.\n\n“Have you any need for a sword?” she asked. “I have some used swords\nvery cheap.”\n\n“I’m going to the front,” I said.\n\n“Oh yes, then you won’t need a sword,” she said.\n\nI paid for the cartridges and the pistol, filled the magazine and put it\nin place, put the pistol in my empty holster, filled the extra clips\nwith cartridges and put them in the leather slots on the holster and\nthen buckled on my belt. The pistol felt heavy on the belt. Still, I\nthought, it was better to have a regulation pistol. You could always get\nshells.\n\n“Now we’re fully armed,” I said. “That was the one thing I had to\nremember to do. Some one got my other one going to the hospital.”\n\n“I hope it’s a good pistol,” Catherine said.\n\n“Was there anything else?” the woman asked.\n\n“I don’t believe so.”\n\n“The pistol has a lanyard,” she said.\n\n“So I noticed.” The woman wanted to sell something else.\n\n“You don’t need a whistle?”\n\n“I don’t believe so.”\n\nThe woman said good-by and we went out onto the sidewalk. Catherine\nlooked in the window. The woman looked out and bowed to us.\n\n“What are those little mirrors set in wood for?”\n\n“They’re for attracting birds. They twirl them out in the field and\nlarks see them and come out and the Italians shoot them.”\n\n“They are an ingenious people,” Catherine said. “You don’t shoot larks\ndo you, darling, in America?”\n\n“Not especially.”\n\nWe crossed the street and started to walk up the other side.\n\n“I feel better now,” Catherine said. “I felt terrible when we started.”\n\n“We always feel good when we’re together.”\n\n“We always will be together.”\n\n“Yes, except that I’m going away at midnight.”\n\n“Don’t think about it, darling.”\n\nWe walked on up the street. The fog made the lights yellow.\n\n“Aren’t you tired?” Catherine asked.\n\n“How about you?”\n\n“I’m all right. It’s fun to walk.”\n\n“But let’s not do it too long.”\n\n“No.”"}
{"text": "We turned down a side street where there were no lights and walked in\nthe street. I stopped and kissed Catherine. While I kissed her I felt\nher hand on my shoulder. She had pulled my cape around her so it covered\nboth of us. We were standing in the street against a high wall.\n\n“Let’s go some place,” I said.\n\n“Good,” said Catherine. We walked on along the street until it came out\nonto a wider street that was beside a canal. On the other side was a\nbrick wall and buildings. Ahead, down the street, I saw a street-car\ncross a bridge.\n\n“We can get a cab up at the bridge,” I said. We stood on the bridge in\nthe fog waiting for a carriage. Several street-cars passed, full of\npeople going home. Then a carriage came along but there was some one in\nit. The fog was turning to rain.\n\n“We could walk or take a tram,” Catherine said.\n\n“One will be along,” I said. “They go by here.”\n\n“Here one comes,” she said.\n\nThe driver stopped his horse and lowered the metal sign on his meter.\nThe top of the carriage was up and there were drops of water on the\ndriver’s coat. His varnished hat was shining in the wet. We sat back in\nthe seat together and the top of the carriage made it dark.\n\n“Where did you tell him to go?”\n\n“To the station. There’s a hotel across from the station where we can\ngo.”\n\n“We can go the way we are? Without luggage?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\nIt was a long ride to the station up side streets in the rain.\n\n“Won’t we have dinner?” Catherine asked. “I’m afraid I’ll be hungry.”\n\n“We’ll have it in our room.”\n\n“I haven’t anything to wear. I haven’t even a nightgown.”\n\n“We’ll get one,” I said and called to the driver.\n\n“Go to the Via Manzoni and up that.” He nodded and turned off to the\nleft at the next corner. On the big street Catherine watched for a shop.\n\n“Here’s a place,” she said. I stopped the driver and Catherine got out,\nwalked across the sidewalk and went inside. I sat back in the carriage\nand waited for her. It was raining and I could smell the wet street and\nthe horse steaming in the rain. She came back with a package and got in\nand we drove on.\n\n“I was very extravagant, darling,” she said, “but it’s a fine\nnightgown.”\n\nAt the hotel I asked Catherine to wait in the carriage while I went in\nand spoke to the manager. There were plenty of rooms. Then I went out to\nthe carriage, paid the driver, and Catherine and I walked in together.\nThe small boy in buttons carried the package. The manager bowed us\ntoward the elevator. There was much red plush and brass. The manager\nwent up in the elevator with us.\n\n“Monsieur and Madame wish dinner in their room?”\n\n“Yes. Will you have the menu brought up?” I said.\n\n“You wish something special for dinner. Some game or a soufflet?”\n\nThe elevator passed three floors with a click each time, then clicked\nand stopped.\n\n“What have you as game?”\n\n“I could get a pheasant, or a woodcock.”\n\n“A woodcock,” I said. We walked down the corridor. The carpet was worn.\nThere were many doors. The manager stopped and unlocked a door and\nopened it.\n\n“Here you are. A lovely room.”\n\nThe small boy in buttons put the package on the table in the centre of\nthe room. The manager opened the curtains.\n\n“It is foggy outside,” he said. The room was furnished in red plush.\nThere were many mirrors, two chairs and a large bed with a satin\ncoverlet. A door led to the bathroom.\n\n“I will send up the menu,” the manager said. He bowed and went out.\n\nI went to the window and looked out, then pulled a cord that shut the\nthick plush curtains. Catherine was sitting on the bed, looking at the\ncut glass chandelier. She had taken her hat off and her hair shone under\nthe light. She saw herself in one of the mirrors and put her hands to\nher hair. I saw her in three other mirrors. She did not look happy. She\nlet her cape fall on the bed.\n\n“What’s the matter, darling?”\n\n“I never felt like a whore before,” she said. I went over to the window\nand pulled the curtain aside and looked out. I had not thought it would\nbe like this.\n\n“You’re not a whore.”\n\n“I know it, darling. But it isn’t nice to feel like one.” Her voice was\ndry and flat."}
{"text": "“This was the best hotel we could get in,” I said. I looked out the\nwindow. Across the square were the lights of the station. There were\ncarriages going by on the street and I saw the trees in the park. The\nlights from the hotel shone on the wet pavement. Oh, hell, I thought, do\nwe have to argue now?\n\n“Come over here please,” Catherine said. The flatness was all gone out\nof her voice. “Come over, please. I’m a good girl again.” I looked over\nat the bed. She was smiling.\n\nI went over and sat on the bed beside her and kissed her.\n\n“You’re my good girl.”\n\n“I’m certainly yours,” she said.\n\nAfter we had eaten we felt fine, and then after, we felt very happy and\nin a little time the room felt like our own home. My room at the\nhospital had been our own home and this room was our home too in the\nsame way.\n\nCatherine wore my tunic over her shoulders while we ate. We were very\nhungry and the meal was good and we drank a bottle of Capri and a bottle\nof St. Estephe. I drank most of it but Catherine drank some and it made\nher feel splendid. For dinner we had a woodcock with soufflé potatoes\nand purée de marron, a salad, and zabaione for dessert.\n\n“It’s a fine room,” Catherine said. “It’s a lovely room. We should have\nstayed here all the time we’ve been in Milan.”\n\n“It’s a funny room. But it’s nice.”\n\n“Vice is a wonderful thing,” Catherine said. “The people who go in for\nit seem to have good taste about it. The red plush is really fine. It’s\njust the thing. And the mirrors are very attractive.”\n\n“You’re a lovely girl.”\n\n“I don’t know how a room like this would be for waking up in the\nmorning. But it’s really a splendid room.” I poured another glass of St.\nEstephe.\n\n“I wish we could do something really sinful,” Catherine said.\n“Everything we do seems so innocent and simple. I can’t believe we do\nanything wrong.”\n\n“You’re a grand girl.”\n\n“I only feel hungry. I get terribly hungry.”\n\n“You’re a fine simple girl,” I said.\n\n“I am a simple girl. No one ever understood it except you.”\n\n“Once when I first met you I spent an afternoon thinking how we would go\nto the Hotel Cavour together and how it would be.”\n\n“That was awfully cheeky of you. This isn’t the Cavour is it?”\n\n“No. They wouldn’t have taken us in there.”\n\n“They’ll take us in some time. But that’s how we differ, darling. I\nnever thought about anything.”\n\n“Didn’t you ever at all?”\n\n“A little,” she said.\n\n“Oh you’re a lovely girl.”\n\nI poured another glass of wine.\n\n“I’m a very simple girl,” Catherine said.\n\n“I didn’t think so at first. I thought you were a crazy girl.”\n\n“I was a little crazy. But I wasn’t crazy in any complicated manner. I\ndidn’t confuse you did I, darling?”\n\n“Wine is a grand thing,” I said. “It makes you forget all the bad.”\n\n“It’s lovely,” said Catherine. “But it’s given my father gout very\nbadly.”\n\n“Have you a father?”\n\n“Yes,” said Catherine. “He has gout. You won’t ever have to meet him.\nHaven’t you a father?”\n\n“No,” I said. “A step-father.”\n\n“Will I like him?”\n\n“You won’t have to meet him.”\n\n“We have such a fine time,” Catherine said. “I don’t take any interest\nin anything else any more. I’m so very happy married to you.”\n\nThe waiter came and took away the things. After a while we were very\nstill and we could hear the rain. Down below on the street a motor car\nhonked.\n\n“‘But at my back I always hear\n               Time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near,’”\n\nI said.\n\n“I know that poem,” Catherine said. “It’s by Marvell. But it’s about a\ngirl who wouldn’t live with a man.”\n\nMy head felt very clear and cold and I wanted to talk facts.\n\n“Where will you have the baby?”\n\n“I don’t know. The best place I can find.”\n\n“How will you arrange it?”\n\n“The best way I can. Don’t worry, darling. We may have several babies\nbefore the war is over.”\n\n“It’s nearly time to go.”\n\n“I know. You can make it time if you want.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then don’t worry, darling. You were fine until now and now you’re\nworrying.”\n\n“I won’t. How often will you write?”\n\n“Every day. Do they read your letters?”\n\n“They can’t read English enough to hurt any.”\n\n“I’ll make them very confusing,” Catherine said.\n\n“But not too confusing.”\n\n“I’ll just make them a little confusing.”\n\n“I’m afraid we have to start to go.”\n\n“All right, darling.”\n\n“I hate to leave our fine house.”\n\n“So do I.”\n\n“But we have to go.”"}
{"text": "“All right. But we’re never settled in our home very long.”\n\n“We will be.”\n\n“I’ll have a fine home for you when you come back.”\n\n“Maybe I’ll be back right away.”\n\n“Perhaps you’ll be hurt just a little in the foot.”\n\n“Or the lobe of the ear.”\n\n“No I want your ears the way they are.”\n\n“And not my feet?”\n\n“Your feet have been hit already.”\n\n“We have to go, darling. Really.”\n\n“All right. You go first.”\n\nWe walked down the stairs instead of taking the elevator. The carpet on\nthe stairs was worn. I had paid for the dinner when it came up and the\nwaiter, who had brought it, was sitting on a chair near the door. He\njumped up and bowed and I went with him into the side room and paid the\nbill for the room. The manager had remembered me as a friend and refused\npayment in advance but when he retired he had remembered to have the\nwaiter stationed at the door so that I should not get out without\npaying. I suppose that had happened; even with his friends. One had so\nmany friends in a war.\n\nI asked the waiter to get us a carriage and he took Catherine’s package\nthat I was carrying and went out with an umbrella. Outside through the\nwindow we saw him crossing the street in the rain. We stood in the side\nroom and looked out the window.\n\n“How do you feel, Cat?”\n\n“Sleepy.”\n\n“I feel hollow and hungry.”\n\n“Have you anything to eat?”\n\n“Yes, in my musette.”\n\nI saw the carriage coming. It stopped, the horse’s head hanging in the\nrain, and the waiter stepped out, opened his umbrella, and came toward\nthe hotel. We met him at the door and walked out under the umbrella down\nthe wet walk to the carriage at the curb. Water was running in the\ngutter.\n\n“There is your package on the seat,” the waiter said. He stood with the\numbrella until we were in and I had tipped him.\n\n“Many thanks. Pleasant journey,” he said. The coachman lifted the reins\nand the horse started. The waiter turned away under the umbrella and\nwent toward the hotel. We drove down the street and turned to the left,\nthen came around to the right in front of the station. There were two\ncarabinieri standing under the light just out of the rain. The light\nshone on their hats. The rain was clear and transparent against the\nlight from the station. A porter came out from under the shelter of the\nstation, his shoulders up against the rain.\n\n“No,” I said. “Thanks. I don’t need thee.”\n\nHe went back under the shelter of the archway. I turned to Catherine.\nHer face was in the shadow from the hood of the carriage.\n\n“We might as well say good-by.”\n\n“I can’t go in?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Good-by, Cat.”\n\n“Will you tell him the hospital?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nI told the driver the address to drive to. He nodded.\n\n“Good-by,” I said. “Take good care of yourself and young Catherine.”\n\n“Good-by, darling.”\n\n“Good-by,” I said. I stepped out into the rain and the carriage started.\nCatherine leaned out and I saw her face in the light. She smiled and\nwaved. The carriage went up the street, Catherine pointed in toward the\narchway. I looked, there were only the two carabinieri and the archway.\nI realized she meant for me to get in out of the rain. I went in and\nstood and watched the carriage turn the corner. Then I started through\nthe station and down the runway to the train.\n\nThe porter was on the platform looking for me. I followed him into the\ntrain, crowding past people and along the aisle and in through a door to\nwhere the machine-gunner sat in the corner of a full compartment. My\nrucksack and musettes were above his head on the luggage rack. There\nwere many men standing in the corridor and the men in the compartment\nall looked at us when we came in. There were not enough places in the\ntrain and every one was hostile. The machine-gunner stood up for me to\nsit down. Some one tapped me on the shoulder. I looked around. It was a\nvery tall gaunt captain of artillery with a red scar along his jaw. He\nhad looked through the glass on the corridor and then come in.\n\n“What do you say?” I asked. I had turned and faced him. He was taller\nthan I and his face was very thin under the shadow of his cap-visor and\nthe scar was new and shiny. Every one in the compartment was looking at\nme.\n\n“You can’t do that,” he said. “You can’t have a soldier save you a\nplace.”\n\n“I have done it.”"}
{"text": "He swallowed and I saw his Adam’s apple go up and then down. The\nmachine-gunner stood in front of the place. Other men looked in through\nthe glass. No one in the compartment said anything.\n\n“You have no right to do that. I was here two hours before you came.”\n\n“What do you want?”\n\n“The seat.”\n\n“So do I.”\n\nI watched his face and could feel the whole compartment against me. I\ndid not blame them. He was in the right. But I wanted the seat. Still no\none said anything.\n\nOh, hell, I thought.\n\n“Sit down, Signor Capitano,” I said. The machine-gunner moved out of the\nway and the tall captain sat down. He looked at me. His face seemed\nhurt. But he had the seat. “Get my things,” I said to the\nmachine-gunner. We went out in the corridor. The train was full and I\nknew there was no chance of a place. I gave the porter and the\nmachine-gunner ten lire apiece. They went down the corridor and outside\non the platform looking in the windows but there were no places.\n\n“Maybe some will get off at Brescia,” the porter said.\n\n“More will get on at Brescia,” said the machine-gunner. I said good-by\nto them and we shook hands and they left. They both felt badly. Inside\nthe train we were all standing in the corridor when the train started. I\nwatched the lights of the station and the yards as we went out. It was\nstill raining and soon the windows were wet and you could not see out.\nLater I slept on the floor of the corridor; first putting my pocket-book\nwith my money and papers in it inside my shirt and trousers so that it\nwas inside the leg of my breeches. I slept all night, waking at Brescia\nand Verona when more men got on the train, but going back to sleep at\nonce. I had my head on one of the musettes and my arms around the other\nand I could feel the pack and they could all walk over me if they\nwouldn’t step on me. Men were sleeping on the floor all down the\ncorridor. Others stood holding on to the window rods or leaning against\nthe doors. That train was always crowded.\n\nNow in the fall the trees were all bare and the roads were muddy. I rode\nto Gorizia from Udine on a camion. We passed other camions on the road\nand I looked at the country. The mulberry trees were bare and the fields\nwere brown. There were wet dead leaves on the road from the rows of bare\ntrees and men were working on the road, tamping stone in the ruts from\npiles of crushed stone along the side of the road between the trees. We\nsaw the town with a mist over it that cut off the mountains. We crossed\nthe river and I saw that it was running high. It had been raining in the\nmountains. We came into the town past the factories and then the houses\nand villas and I saw that many more houses had been hit. On a narrow\nstreet we passed a British Red Cross ambulance. The driver wore a cap\nand his face was thin and very tanned. I did not know him. I got down\nfrom the camion in the big square in front of the Town Major’s house,\nthe driver handed down my rucksack and I put it on and swung on the two\nmusettes and walked to our villa. It did not feel like a homecoming.\n\nI walked down the damp gravel driveway looking at the villa through the\ntrees. The windows were all shut but the door was open. I went in and\nfound the major sitting at a table in the bare room with maps and typed\nsheets of paper on the wall.\n\n“Hello,” he said. “How are you?” He looked older and drier.\n\n“I’m good,” I said. “How is everything?”\n\n“It’s all over,” he said. “Take off your kit and sit down.” I put my\npack and the two musettes on the floor and my cap on the pack. I brought\nthe other chair over from the wall and sat down by the desk.\n\n“It’s been a bad summer,” the major said. “Are you strong now?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Did you ever get the decorations?”\n\n“Yes. I got them fine. Thank you very much.”\n\n“Let’s see them.”\n\nI opened my cape so he could see the two ribbons.\n\n“Did you get the boxes with the medals?”\n\n“No. Just the papers.”\n\n“The boxes will come later. That takes more time.”\n\n“What do you want me to do?”\n\n“The cars are all away. There are six up north at Caporetto. You know\nCaporetto?”"}
{"text": "“Yes,” I said. I remembered it as a little white town with a campanile\nin a valley. It was a clean little town and there was a fine fountain in\nthe square.\n\n“They are working from there. There are many sick now. The fighting is\nover.”\n\n“Where are the others?”\n\n“There are two up in the mountains and four still on the Bainsizza. The\nother two ambulance sections are in the Carso with the third army.”\n\n“What do you wish me to do?”\n\n“You can go and take over the four cars on the Bainsizza if you like.\nGino has been up there a long time. You haven’t seen it up there, have\nyou?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“It was very bad. We lost three cars.”\n\n“I heard about it.”\n\n“Yes, Rinaldi wrote you.”\n\n“Where is Rinaldi?”\n\n“He is here at the hospital. He has had a summer and fall of it.”\n\n“I believe it.”\n\n“It has been bad,” the major said. “You couldn’t believe how bad it’s\nbeen. I’ve often thought you were lucky to be hit when you were.”\n\n“I know I was.”\n\n“Next year will be worse,” the major said. “Perhaps they will attack\nnow. They say they are to attack but I can’t believe it. It is too late.\nYou saw the river?”\n\n“Yes. It’s high already.”\n\n“I don’t believe they will attack now that the rains have started. We\nwill have the snow soon. What about your countrymen? Will there be other\nAmericans besides yourself?”\n\n“They are training an army of ten million.”\n\n“I hope we get some of them. But the French will hog them all. We’ll\nnever get any down here. All right. You stay here to-night and go out\nto-morrow with the little car and send Gino back. I’ll send somebody\nwith you that knows the road. Gino will tell you everything. They are\nshelling quite a little still but it is all over. You will want to see\nthe Bainsizza.”\n\n“I’m glad to see it. I am glad to be back with you again, Signor\nMaggiore.”\n\nHe smiled. “You are very good to say so. I am very tired of this war. If\nI was away I do not believe I would come back.”\n\n“Is it so bad?”\n\n“Yes. It is so bad and worse. Go get cleaned up and find your friend\nRinaldi.”\n\nI went out and carried my bags up the stairs. Rinaldi was not in the\nroom but his things were there and I sat down on the bed and unwrapped\nmy puttees and took the shoe off my right foot. Then I lay back on the\nbed. I was tired and my right foot hurt. It seemed silly to lie on the\nbed with one shoe off, so I sat up and unlaced the other shoe and\ndropped it on the floor, then lay back on the blanket again. The room\nwas stuffy with the window closed but I was too tired to get up and open\nit. I saw my things were all in one corner of the room. Outside it was\ngetting dark. I lay on the bed and thought about Catherine and waited\nfor Rinaldi. I was going to try not to think about Catherine except at\nnight before I went to sleep. But now I was tired and there was nothing\nto do, so I lay and thought about her. I was thinking about her when\nRinaldi came in. He looked just the same. Perhaps he was a little\nthinner.\n\n“Well, baby,” he said. I sat up on the bed. He came over, sat down and\nput his arm around me. “Good old baby.” He whacked me on the back and I\nheld both his arms.\n\n“Old baby,” he said. “Let me see your knee.”\n\n“I’ll have to take off my pants.”\n\n“Take off your pants, baby. We’re all friends here. I want to see what\nkind of a job they did.” I stood up, took off the breeches and pulled\noff the knee-brace. Rinaldi sat on the floor and bent the knee gently\nback and forth. He ran his finger along the scar; put his thumbs\ntogether over the kneecap and rocked the knee gently with his fingers.\n\n“Is that all the articulation you have?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It’s a crime to send you back. They ought to get complete\narticulation.”\n\n“It’s a lot better than it was. It was stiff as a board.”\n\nRinaldi bent it more. I watched his hands. He had fine surgeon’s hands.\nI looked at the top of his head, his hair shiny and parted smoothly. He\nbent the knee too far.\n\n“Ouch!” I said.\n\n“You ought to have more treatment on it with the machines,” Rinaldi\nsaid.\n\n“It’s better than it was.”\n\n“I see that, baby. This is something I know more about than you.” He\nstood up and sat down on the bed. “The knee itself is a good job.” He\nwas through with the knee. “Tell me all about everything.”"}
{"text": "“There’s nothing to tell,” I said. “I’ve led a quiet life.”\n\n“You act like a married man,” he said. “What’s the matter with you?”\n\n“Nothing,” I said. “What’s the matter with you?”\n\n“This war is killing me,” Rinaldi said, “I am very depressed by it.” He\nfolded his hands over his knee.\n\n“Oh,” I said.\n\n“What’s the matter? Can’t I even have human impulses?”\n\n“No. I can see you’ve been having a fine time. Tell me.”\n\n“All summer and all fall I’ve operated. I work all the time. I do\neverybody’s work. All the hard ones they leave to me. By God, baby, I am\nbecoming a lovely surgeon.”\n\n“That sounds better.”\n\n“I never think. No, by God, I don’t think; I operate.”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n“But now, baby, it’s all over. I don’t operate now and I feel like hell.\nThis is a terrible war, baby. You believe me when I say it. Now you\ncheer me up. Did you bring the phonograph records?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nThey were wrapped in paper in a cardboard box in my rucksack. I was too\ntired to get them out.\n\n“Don’t you feel good yourself, baby?”\n\n“I feel like hell.”\n\n“This war is terrible,” Rinaldi said. “Come on. We’ll both get drunk and\nbe cheerful. Then we’ll go get the ashes dragged. Then we’ll feel fine.”\n\n“I’ve had the jaundice,” I said, “and I can’t get drunk.”\n\n“Oh, baby, how you’ve come back to me. You come back serious and with a\nliver. I tell you this war is a bad thing. Why did we make it anyway?”\n\n“We’ll have a drink. I don’t want to get drunk but we’ll have a drink.”\n\nRinaldi went across the room to the washstand and brought back two\nglasses and a bottle of cognac.\n\n“It’s Austrian cognac,” he said. “Seven stars. It’s all they captured on\nSan Gabriele.”\n\n“Were you up there?”\n\n“No. I haven’t been anywhere. I’ve been here all the time operating.\nLook, baby, this is your old toothbrushing glass. I kept it all the time\nto remind me of you.”\n\n“To remind you to brush your teeth.”\n\n“No. I have my own too. I kept this to remind me of you trying to brush\naway the Villa Rossa from your teeth in the morning, swearing and eating\naspirin and cursing harlots. Every time I see that glass I think of you\ntrying to clean your conscience with a toothbrush.” He came over to the\nbed. “Kiss me once and tell me you’re not serious.”\n\n“I never kiss you. You’re an ape.”\n\n“I know, you are the fine good Anglo-Saxon boy. I know. You are the\nremorse boy, I know. I will wait till I see the Anglo-Saxon brushing\naway harlotry with a toothbrush.”\n\n“Put some cognac in the glass.”\n\nWe touched glasses and drank. Rinaldi laughed at me.\n\n“I will get you drunk and take out your liver and put you in a good\nItalian liver and make you a man again.”\n\nI held the glass for some more cognac. It was dark outside now. Holding\nthe glass of cognac, I went over and opened the window. The rain had\nstopped falling. It was colder outside and there was a mist in the\ntrees.\n\n“Don’t throw the cognac out the window,” Rinaldi said. “If you can’t\ndrink it give it to me.”\n\n“Go something yourself,” I said. I was glad to see Rinaldi again. He had\nspent two years teasing me and I had always liked it. We understood each\nother very well.\n\n“Are you married?” he asked from the bed. I was standing against the\nwall by the window.\n\n“Not yet.”\n\n“Are you in love?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“With that English girl?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Poor baby. Is she good to you?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“I mean is she good to you practically speaking?”\n\n“Shut up.”\n\n“I will. You will see I am a man of extreme delicacy. Does she——?”\n\n“Rinin,” I said. “Please shut up. If you want to be my friend, shut up.”\n\n“I don’t _want_ to be your friend, baby. I _am_ your friend.”\n\n“Then shut up.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nI went over to the bed and sat down beside Rinaldi. He was holding his\nglass and looking at the floor.\n\n“You see how it is, Rinin?”\n\n“Oh, yes. All my life I encounter sacred subjects. But very few with\nyou. I suppose you must have them too.” He looked at the floor.\n\n“You haven’t any?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Not any?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I can say this about your mother and that about your sister?”\n\n“And that about _your sister_,” Rinaldi said swiftly. We both laughed.\n\n“The old superman,” I said.\n\n“I am jealous maybe,” Rinaldi said.\n\n“No, you’re not.”\n\n“I don’t mean like that. I mean something else. Have you any married\nfriends?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\n“I haven’t,” Rinaldi said. “Not if they love each other.”\n\n“Why not?”"}
{"text": "“They don’t like me.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“I am the snake. I am the snake of reason.”\n\n“You’re getting it mixed. The apple was reason.”\n\n“No, it was the snake.” He was more cheerful.\n\n“You are better when you don’t think so deeply,” I said.\n\n“I love you, baby,” he said. “You puncture me when I become a great\nItalian thinker. But I know many things I can’t say. I know more than\nyou.”\n\n“Yes. You do.”\n\n“But you will have a better time. Even with remorse you will have a\nbetter time.”\n\n“I don’t think so.”\n\n“Oh, yes. That is true. Already I am only happy when I am working.” He\nlooked at the floor again.\n\n“You’ll get over that.”\n\n“No. I only like two other things; one is bad for my work and the other\nis over in half an hour or fifteen minutes. Sometimes less.”\n\n“Sometimes a good deal less.”\n\n“Perhaps I have improved, baby. You do not know. But there are only the\ntwo things and my work.”\n\n“You’ll get other things.”\n\n“No. We never get anything. We are born with all we have and we never\nlearn. We never get anything new. We all start complete. You should be\nglad not to be a Latin.”\n\n“There’s no such thing as a Latin. That is ‘Latin’ thinking. You are so\nproud of your defects.” Rinaldi looked up and laughed.\n\n“We’ll stop, baby. I am tired from thinking so much.” He had looked\ntired when he came in. “It’s nearly time to eat. I’m glad you’re back.\nYou are my best friend and my war brother.”\n\n“When do the war brothers eat?” I asked.\n\n“Right away. We’ll drink once more for your liver’s sake.”\n\n“Like Saint Paul.”\n\n“You are inaccurate. That was wine and the stomach. Take a little wine\nfor your stomach’s sake.”\n\n“Whatever you have in the bottle,” I said. “For any sake you mention.”\n\n“To your girl,” Rinaldi said. He held out his glass.\n\n“All right.”\n\n“I’ll never say a dirty thing about her.”\n\n“Don’t strain yourself.”\n\nHe drank off the cognac. “I am pure,” he said. “I am like you, baby. I\nwill get an English girl too. As a matter of fact I knew your girl first\nbut she was a little tall for me. A tall girl for a sister,” he quoted.\n\n“You have a lovely pure mind,” I said.\n\n“Haven’t I? That’s why they call me Rinaldo Purissimo.”\n\n“Rinaldo Sporchissimo.”\n\n“Come on, baby, we’ll go down to eat while my mind is still pure.”\n\nI washed, combed my hair and we went down the stairs. Rinaldi was a\nlittle drunk. In the room where we ate, the meal was not quite ready.\n\n“I’ll go get the bottle,” Rinaldi said. He went off up the stairs. I sat\nat the table and he came back with the bottle and poured us each a half\ntumbler of cognac.\n\n“Too much,” I said and held up the glass and sighted at the lamp on the\ntable.\n\n“Not for an empty stomach. It is a wonderful thing. It burns out the\nstomach completely. Nothing is worse for you.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Self-destruction day by day,” Rinaldi said. “It ruins the stomach and\nmakes the hand shake. Just the thing for a surgeon.”\n\n“You recommend it?”\n\n“Heartily. I use no other. Drink it down, baby, and look forward to\nbeing sick.”\n\nI drank half the glass. In the hall I could hear the orderly calling.\n“Soup! Soup is ready!”\n\nThe major came in, nodded to us and sat down. He seemed very small at\ntable.\n\n“Is this all we are?” he asked. The orderly put the soup bowl down and\nhe ladled out a plate full.\n\n“We are all,” Rinaldi said. “Unless the priest comes. If he knew\nFederico was here he would be here.”\n\n“Where is he?” I asked.\n\n“He’s at 307,” the major said. He was busy with his soup. He wiped his\nmouth, wiping his upturned gray mustache carefully. “He will come I\nthink. I called them and left word to tell him you were here.”\n\n“I miss the noise of the mess,” I said.\n\n“Yes, it’s quiet,” the major said.\n\n“I will be noisy,” said Rinaldi.\n\n“Drink some wine, Enrico,” said the major. He filled my glass. The\nspaghetti came in and we were all busy. We were finishing the spaghetti\nwhen the priest came in. He was the same as ever, small and brown and\ncompact looking. I stood up and we shook hands. He put his hand on my\nshoulder.\n\n“I came as soon as I heard,” he said.\n\n“Sit down,” the major said. “You’re late.”"}
{"text": "“Good-evening, priest,” Rinaldi said, using the English word. They had\ntaken that up from the priest-baiting captain, who spoke a little\nEnglish. “Good-evening, Rinaldo,” the priest said. The orderly brought\nhim soup but he said he would start with the spaghetti.\n\n“How are you?” he asked me.\n\n“Fine,” I said. “How have things been?”\n\n“Drink some wine, priest,” Rinaldi said. “Take a little wine for your\nstomach’s sake. That’s Saint Paul, you know.”\n\n“Yes I know,” said the priest politely. Rinaldi filled his glass.\n\n“That Saint Paul,” said Rinaldi. “He’s the one who makes all the\ntrouble.” The priest looked at me and smiled. I could see that the\nbaiting did not touch him now.\n\n“That Saint Paul,” Rinaldi said. “He was a rounder and a chaser and then\nwhen he was no longer hot he said it was no good. When he was finished\nhe made the rules for us who are still hot. Isn’t it true, Federico?”\n\nThe major smiled. We were eating meat stew now.\n\n“I never discuss a Saint after dark,” I said. The priest looked up from\nthe stew and smiled at me.\n\n“There he is, gone over with the priest,” Rinaldi said. “Where are all\nthe good old priest-baiters? Where is Cavalcanti? Where is Brundi? Where\nis Cesare? Do I have to bait this priest alone without support?”\n\n“He is a good priest,” said the major.\n\n“He is a good priest,” said Rinaldi. “But still a priest. I try to make\nthe mess like the old days. I want to make Federico happy. To hell with\nyou, priest!”\n\nI saw the major look at him and notice that he was drunk. His thin face\nwas white. The line of his hair was very black against the white of his\nforehead.\n\n“It’s all right, Rinaldo,” said the priest. “It’s all right.”\n\n“To hell with you,” said Rinaldi. “To hell with the whole damn\nbusiness.” He sat back in his chair.\n\n“He’s been under a strain and he’s tired,” the major said to me. He\nfinished his meat and wiped up the gravy with a piece of bread.\n\n“I don’t give a damn,” Rinaldi said to the table. “To hell with the\nwhole business.” He looked defiantly around the table, his eyes flat,\nhis face pale.\n\n“All right,” I said. “To hell with the whole damn business.”\n\n“No, no,” said Rinaldi. “You can’t do it. You can’t do it. I say you\ncan’t do it. You’re dry and you’re empty and there’s nothing else.\nThere’s nothing else I tell you. Not a damned thing. I know, when I stop\nworking.”\n\nThe priest shook his head. The orderly took away the stew dish.\n\n“What are you eating meat for?” Rinaldi turned to the priest. “Don’ you\nknow it’s Friday?”\n\n“It’s Thursday,” the priest said.\n\n“It’s a lie. It’s Friday. You’re eating the body of our Lord. It’s\nGod-meat. I know. It’s dead Austrian. That’s what you’re eating.”\n\n“The white meat is from officers,” I said, completing the old joke.\n\nRinaldi laughed. He filled his glass.\n\n“Don’t mind me,” he said. “I’m just a little crazy.”\n\n“You ought to have a leave,” the priest said.\n\nThe major shook his head at him. Rinaldi looked at the priest.\n\n“You think I ought to have a leave?”\n\nThe major shook his head at the priest. Rinaldi was looking at the\npriest.\n\n“Just as you like,” the priest said. “Not if you don’t want.”\n\n“To hell with you,” Rinaldi said. “They try to get rid of me. Every\nnight they try to get rid of me. I fight them off. What if I have it.\nEverybody has it. The whole world’s got it. First,” he went on, assuming\nthe manner of a lecturer, “it’s a little pimple. Then we notice a rash\nbetween the shoulders. Then we notice nothing at all. We put our faith\nin mercury.”\n\n“Or salvarsan,” the major interrupted quietly.\n\n“A mercurial product,” Rinaldi said. He acted very elated now. “I know\nsomething worth two of that. Good old priest,” he said. “You’ll never\nget it. Baby will get it. It’s an industrial accident. It’s a simple\nindustrial accident.”\n\nThe orderly brought in the sweet and coffee. The dessert was a sort of\nblack bread pudding with hard sauce. The lamp was smoking; the black\nsmoke going close up inside the chimney.\n\n“Bring two candles and take away the lamp,” the major said. The orderly\nbrought two lighted candles each in a saucer, and took out the lamp\nblowing it out. Rinaldi was quiet now. He seemed all right. We talked\nand after the coffee we all went out into the hall."}
{"text": "“You want to talk to the priest. I have to go in the town,” Rinaldi\nsaid. “Good-night, priest.”\n\n“Good-night, Rinaldo,” the priest said.\n\n“I’ll see you Fredi,” Rinaldi said.\n\n“Yes,” I said. “Come in early.” He made a face and went out the door.\nThe major was standing with us. “He’s very tired and overworked,” he\nsaid. “He thinks too he has syphilis. I don’t believe it but he may\nhave. He is treating himself for it. Good-night. You will leave before\ndaylight, Enrico?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Good-by then,” he said. “Good luck. Peduzzi will wake you and go with\nyou.”\n\n“Good-by, Signor Maggiore.”\n\n“Good-by. They talk about an Austrian offensive but I don’t believe it.\nI hope not. But anyway it won’t be here. Gino will tell you everything.\nThe telephone works well now.”\n\n“I’ll call regularly.”\n\n“Please do. Good-night. Don’t let Rinaldi drink so much brandy.”\n\n“I’ll try not to.”\n\n“Good-night, priest.”\n\n“Good-night, Signor Maggiore.”\n\nHe went off into his office.\n\nI went to the door and looked out. It had stopped raining but there was\na mist.\n\n“Should we go upstairs?” I asked the priest.\n\n“I can only stay a little while.”\n\n“Come on up.”\n\nWe climbed the stairs and went into my room. I lay down on Rinaldi’s\nbed. The priest sat on my cot that the orderly had set up. It was dark\nin the room.\n\n“Well,” he said, “how are you really?”\n\n“I’m all right. I’m tired to-night.”\n\n“I’m tired too, but from no cause.”\n\n“What about the war?”\n\n“I think it will be over soon. I don’t know why, but I feel it.”\n\n“How do you feel it?”\n\n“You know how your major is? Gentle? Many people are like that now.”\n\n“I feel that way myself,” I said.\n\n“It has been a terrible summer,” said the priest. He was surer of\nhimself now than when I had gone away. “You cannot believe how it has\nbeen. Except that you have been there and you know how it can be. Many\npeople have realized the war this summer. Officers whom I thought could\nnever realize it realize it now.”\n\n“What will happen?” I stroked the blanket with my hand.\n\n“I do not know but I do not think it can go on much longer.”\n\n“What will happen?”\n\n“They will stop fighting.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Both sides.”\n\n“I hope so,” I said.\n\n“You don’t believe it?”\n\n“I don’t believe both sides will stop fighting at once.”\n\n“I suppose not. It is too much to expect. But when I see the changes in\nmen I do not think it can go on.”\n\n“Who won the fighting this summer?”\n\n“No one.”\n\n“The Austrians won,” I said. “They kept them from taking San Gabriele.\nThey’ve won. They won’t stop fighting.”\n\n“If they feel as we feel they may stop. They have gone through the same\nthing.”\n\n“No one ever stopped when they were winning.”\n\n“You discourage me.”\n\n“I can only say what I think.”\n\n“Then you think it will go on and on? Nothing will ever happen?”\n\n“I don’t know. I only think the Austrians will not stop when they have\nwon a victory. It is in defeat that we become Christian.”\n\n“The Austrians are Christians—except for the Bosnians.”\n\n“I don’t mean technically Christian. I mean like Our Lord.”\n\nHe said nothing.\n\n“We are all gentler now because we are beaten. How would Our Lord have\nbeen if Peter had rescued him in the Garden?”\n\n“He would have been just the same.”\n\n“I don’t think so,” I said.\n\n“You discourage me,” he said. “I believe and I pray that something will\nhappen. I have felt it very close.”\n\n“Something may happen,” I said. “But it will happen only to us. If they\nfelt the way we do, it would be all right. But they have beaten us. They\nfeel another way.”\n\n“Many of the soldiers have always felt this way. It is not because they\nwere beaten.”\n\n“They were beaten to start with. They were beaten when they took them\nfrom their farms and put them in the army. That is why the peasant has\nwisdom, because he is defeated from the start. Put him in power and see\nhow wise he is.”\n\nHe did not say anything. He was thinking.\n\n“Now I am depressed myself,” I said. “That’s why I never think about\nthese things. I never think and yet when I begin to talk I say the\nthings I have found out in my mind without thinking.”\n\n“I had hoped for something.”\n\n“Defeat?”\n\n“No. Something more.”\n\n“There isn’t anything more. Except victory. It may be worse.”\n\n“I hoped for a long time for victory.”\n\n“Me too.”\n\n“Now I don’t know.”\n\n“It has to be one or the other.”\n\n“I don’t believe in victory any more.”"}
{"text": "“I don’t. But I don’t believe in defeat. Though it may be better.”\n\n“What do you believe in?”\n\n“In sleep,” I said. He stood up.\n\n“I am very sorry to have stayed so long. But I like so to talk with\nyou.”\n\n“It is very nice to talk again. I said that about sleeping, meaning\nnothing.”\n\nWe stood up and shook hands in the dark.\n\n“I sleep at 307 now,” he said.\n\n“I go out on post early to-morrow.”\n\n“I’ll see you when you come back.”\n\n“We’ll have a walk and talk together.” I walked with him to the door.\n\n“Don’t go down,” he said. “It is very nice that you are back. Though not\nso nice for you.” He put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n“It’s all right for me,” I said. “Good-night.”\n\n“Good-night. Ciaou!”\n\n“Ciaou!” I said. I was deadly sleepy.\n\nI woke when Rinaldi came in but he did not talk and I went back to sleep\nagain. In the morning I was dressed and gone before it was light.\nRinaldi did not wake when I left.\n\nI had not seen the Bainsizza before and it was strange to go up the\nslope where the Austrians had been, beyond the place on the river where\nI had been wounded. There was a steep new road and many trucks. Beyond,\nthe road flattened out and I saw woods and steep hills in the mist.\nThere were woods that had been taken quickly and not smashed. Then\nbeyond where the road was not protected by the hills it was screened by\nmatting on the sides and over the top. The road ended in a wrecked\nvillage. The lines were up beyond. There was much artillery around. The\nhouses were badly smashed but things were very well organized and there\nwere signboards everywhere. We found Gino and he got us some coffee and\nlater I went with him and met various people and saw the posts. Gino\nsaid the British cars were working further down the Bainsizza at Ravne.\nHe had great admiration for the British. There was still a certain\namount of shelling, he said, but not many wounded. There would be many\nsick now the rains had started. The Austrians were supposed to attack\nbut he did not believe it. We were supposed to attack too, but they had\nnot brought up any new troops so he thought that was off too. Food was\nscarce and he would be glad to get a full meal in Gorizia. What kind of\nsupper had I had? I told him and he said that would be wonderful. He was\nespecially impressed by the _dolce_. I did not describe it in detail,\nonly said it was a _dolce_, and I think he believed it was something\nmore elaborate than bread pudding.\n\nDid I know where he was going to go? I said I didn’t but that some of\nthe other cars were at Caporetto. He hoped he would go up that way. It\nwas a nice little place and he liked the high mountain hauling up\nbeyond. He was a nice boy and every one seemed to like him. He said\nwhere it really had been hell was at San Gabriele and the attack beyond\nLom that had gone bad. He said the Austrians had a great amount of\nartillery in the woods along Ternova ridge beyond and above us, and\nshelled the roads badly at night. There was a battery of naval guns that\nhad gotten on his nerves. I would recognize them because of their flat\ntrajectory. You heard the report and then the shriek commenced almost\ninstantly. They usually fired two guns at once, one right after the\nother, and the fragments from the burst were enormous. He showed me one,\na smoothly jagged piece of metal over a foot long. It looked like\nbabbiting metal.\n\n“I don’t suppose they are so effective,” Gino said. “But they scare me.\nThey all sound as though they came directly for you. There is the boom,\nthen instantly the shriek and burst. What’s the use of not being wounded\nif they scare you to death?”\n\nHe said there were Croats in the lines opposite us now and some Magyars.\nOur troops were still in the attacking positions. There was no wire to\nspeak of and no place to fall back to if there should be an Austrian\nattack. There were fine positions for defense along the low mountains\nthat came up out of the plateau but nothing had been done about\norganizing them for defense. What did I think about the Bainsizza\nanyway?\n\nI had expected it to be flatter, more like a plateau. I had not realized\nit was so broken up.\n\n“Alto piano,” Gino said, “but no piano.”"}
{"text": "We went back to the cellar of the house where he lived. I said I thought\na ridge that flattened out on top and had a little depth would be easier\nand more practical to hold than a succession of small mountains. It was\nno harder to attack up a mountain than on the level, I argued. “That\ndepends on the mountains,” he said. “Look at San Gabriele.”\n\n“Yes,” I said, “but where they had trouble was at the top where it was\nflat. They got up to the top easy enough.”\n\n“Not so easy,” he said.\n\n“Yes,” I said, “but that was a special case because it was a fortress\nrather than a mountain, anyway. The Austrians had been fortifying it for\nyears.” I meant tactically speaking in a war where there was some\nmovement a succession of mountains were nothing to hold as a line\nbecause it was too easy to turn them. You should have possible mobility\nand a mountain is not very mobile. Also, people always over-shoot down\nhill. If the flank were turned, the best men would be left on the\nhighest mountains. I did not believe in a war in mountains. I had\nthought about it a lot, I said. You pinched off one mountain and they\npinched off another but when something really started every one had to\nget down off the mountains.\n\nWhat were you going to do if you had a mountain frontier? he asked.\n\nI had not worked that out yet, I said, and we both laughed. “But,” I\nsaid, “in the old days the Austrians were always whipped in the\nquadrilateral around Verona. They let them come down onto the plain and\nwhipped them there.”\n\n“Yes,” said Gino. “But those were Frenchmen and you can work out\nmilitary problems clearly when you are fighting in somebody else’s\ncountry.”\n\n“Yes,” I agreed, “when it is your own country you cannot use it so\nscientifically.”\n\n“The Russians did, to trap Napoleon.”\n\n“Yes, but they had plenty of country. If you tried to retreat to trap\nNapoleon in Italy you would find yourself in Brindisi.”\n\n“A terrible place,” said Gino. “Have you ever been there?”\n\n“Not to stay.”\n\n“I am a patriot,” Gino said. “But I cannot love Brindisi or Taranto.”\n\n“Do you love the Bainsizza?” I asked.\n\n“The soil is sacred,” he said. “But I wish it grew more potatoes. You\nknow when we came here we found fields of potatoes the Austrians had\nplanted.”\n\n“Has the food really been short?”\n\n“I myself have never had enough to eat but I am a big eater and I have\nnot starved. The mess is average. The regiments in the line get pretty\ngood food but those in support don’t get so much. Something is wrong\nsomewhere. There should be plenty of food.”\n\n“The dogfish are selling it somewhere else.”\n\n“Yes, they give the battalions in the front line as much as they can but\nthe ones in back are very short. They have eaten all the Austrians’\npotatoes and chestnuts from the woods. They ought to feed them better.\nWe are big eaters. I am sure there is plenty of food. It is very bad for\nthe soldiers to be short of food. Have you ever noticed the difference\nit makes in the way you think?”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “It can’t win a war but it can lose one.”\n\n“We won’t talk about losing. There is enough talk about losing. What has\nbeen done this summer cannot have been done in vain.”"}
{"text": "I did not say anything. I was always embarrassed by the words sacred,\nglorious, and sacrifice and the expression in vain. We had heard them,\nsometimes standing in the rain almost out of earshot, so that only the\nshouted words came through, and had read them, on proclamations that\nwere slapped up by billposters over other proclamations, now for a long\ntime, and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious\nhad no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if\nnothing was done with the meat except to bury it. There were many words\nthat you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places\nhad dignity. Certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and\nthese with the names of the places were all you could say and have them\nmean anything. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow\nwere obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the numbers of\nroads, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates. Gino\nwas a patriot, so he said things that separated us sometimes, but he was\nalso a fine boy and I understood his being a patriot. He was born one.\nHe left with Peduzzi in the car to go back to Gorizia.\n\nIt stormed all that day. The wind drove down the rain and everywhere\nthere was standing water and mud. The plaster of the broken houses was\ngray and wet. Late in the afternoon the rain stopped and from out number\ntwo post I saw the bare wet autumn country with clouds over the tops of\nthe hills and the straw screening over the roads wet and dripping. The\nsun came out once before it went down and shone on the bare woods beyond\nthe ridge. There were many Austrian guns in the woods on that ridge but\nonly a few fired. I watched the sudden round puffs of shrapnel smoke in\nthe sky above a broken farmhouse near where the line was; soft puffs\nwith a yellow white flash in the centre. You saw the flash, then heard\nthe crack, then saw the smoke ball distort and thin in the wind. There\nwere many iron shrapnel balls in the rubble of the houses and on the\nroad beside the broken house where the post was, but they did not shell\nnear the post that afternoon. We loaded two cars and drove down the road\nthat was screened with wet mats and the last of the sun came through in\nthe breaks between the strips of mattings. Before we were out on the\nclear road behind the hill the sun was down. We went on down the clear\nroad and as it turned a corner into the open and went into the square\narched tunnel of matting the rain started again.\n\nThe wind rose in the night and at three o’clock in the morning with the\nrain coming in sheets there was a bombardment and the Croatians came\nover across the mountain meadows and through patches of woods and into\nthe front line. They fought in the dark in the rain and a counter-attack\nof scared men from the second line drove them back. There was much\nshelling and many rockets in the rain and machine-gun and rifle fire all\nalong the line. They did not come again and it was quieter and between\nthe gusts of wind and rain we could hear the sound of a great\nbombardment far to the north.\n\nThe wounded were coming into the post, some were carried on stretchers,\nsome walking and some were brought on the backs of men that came across\nthe field. They were wet to the skin and all were scared. We filled two\ncars with stretcher cases as they came up from the cellar of the post\nand as I shut the door of the second car and fastened it I felt the rain\non my face turn to snow. The flakes were coming heavy and fast in the\nrain."}
{"text": "When daylight came the storm was still blowing but the snow had stopped.\nIt had melted as it fell on the wet ground and now it was raining again.\nThere was another attack just after daylight but it was unsuccessful. We\nexpected an attack all day but it did not come until the sun was going\ndown. The bombardment started to the south below the long wooded ridge\nwhere the Austrian guns were concentrated. We expected a bombardment but\nit did not come. It was getting dark. Guns were firing from the field\nbehind the village and the shells, going away, had a comfortable sound.\n\nWe heard that the attack to the south had been unsuccessful. They did\nnot attack that night but we heard that they had broken through to the\nnorth. In the night word came that we were to prepare to retreat. The\ncaptain at the post told me this. He had it from the Brigade. A little\nwhile later he came from the telephone and said it was a lie. The\nBrigade had received orders that the line of the Bainsizza should be\nheld no matter what happened. I asked about the break through and he\nsaid that he had heard at the Brigade that the Austrians had broken\nthrough the twenty-seventh army corps up toward Caporetto. There had\nbeen a great battle in the north all day.\n\n“If those bastards let them through we are cooked,” he said.\n\n“It’s Germans that are attacking,” one of the medical officers said. The\nword Germans was something to be frightened of. We did not want to have\nanything to do with the Germans.\n\n“There are fifteen divisions of Germans,” the medical officer said.\n“They have broken through and we will be cut off.”\n\n“At the Brigade, they say this line is to be held. They say they have\nnot broken through badly and that we will hold a line across the\nmountains from Monte Maggiore.”\n\n“Where do they hear this?”\n\n“From the Division.”\n\n“The word that we were to retreat came from the Division.”\n\n“We work under the Army Corps,” I said. “But here I work under you.\nNaturally when you tell me to go I will go. But get the orders\nstraight.”\n\n“The orders are that we stay here. You clear the wounded from here to\nthe clearing station.”\n\n“Sometimes we clear from the clearing station to the field hospitals\ntoo,” I said. “Tell me, I have never seen a retreat—if there is a\nretreat how are all the wounded evacuated?”\n\n“They are not. They take as many as they can and leave the rest.”\n\n“What will I take in the cars?”\n\n“Hospital equipment.”\n\n“All right,” I said.\n\nThe next night the retreat started. We heard that Germans and Austrians\nhad broken through in the north and were coming down the mountain\nvalleys toward Cividale and Udine. The retreat was orderly, wet and\nsullen. In the night, going slowly along the crowded roads we passed\ntroops marching under the rain, guns, horses pulling wagons, mules,\nmotor trucks, all moving away from the front. There was no more disorder\nthan in an advance.\n\nThat night we helped empty the field hospitals that had been set up in\nthe least ruined villages of the plateau, taking the wounded down to\nPlava on the river-bed: and the next day hauled all day in the rain to\nevacuate the hospitals and clearing station at Plava. It rained steadily\nand the army of the Bainsizza moved down off the plateau in the October\nrain and across the river where the great victories had commenced in the\nspring of that year. We came into Gorizia in the middle of the next day.\nThe rain had stopped and the town was nearly empty. As we came up the\nstreet they were loading the girls from the soldiers’ whorehouse into a\ntruck. There were seven girls and they had on their hats and coats and\ncarried small suitcases. Two of them were crying. Of the others one\nsmiled at us and put out her tongue and fluttered it up and down. She\nhad thick full lips and black eyes.\n\nI stopped the car and went over and spoke to the matron. The girls from\nthe officers’ house had left early that morning, she said. Where were\nthey going? To Conegliano, she said. The truck started. The girl with\nthick lips put out her tongue again at us. The matron waved. The two\ngirls kept on crying. The others looked interestedly out at the town. I\ngot back in the car."}
{"text": "“We ought to go with them,” Bonello said. “That would be a good trip.”\n\n“We’ll have a good trip,” I said.\n\n“We’ll have a hell of a trip.”\n\n“That’s what I mean,” I said. We came up the drive to the villa.\n\n“I’d like to be there when some of those tough babies climb in and try\nand hop them.”\n\n“You think they will?”\n\n“Sure. Everybody in the Second Army knows that matron.”\n\nWe were outside the villa.\n\n“They call her the Mother Superior,” Bonello said. “The girls are new\nbut everybody knows her. They must have brought them up just before the\nretreat.”\n\n“They’ll have a time.”\n\n“I’ll say they’ll have a time. I’d like to have a crack at them for\nnothing. They charge too much at that house anyway. The government gyps\nus.”\n\n“Take the car out and have the mechanics go over it,” I said. “Change\nthe oil and check the differential. Fill it up and then get some sleep.”\n\n“Yes, Signor Tenente.”\n\nThe villa was empty. Rinaldi was gone with the hospital. The major was\ngone taking hospital personnel in the staff car. There was a note on the\nwindow for me to fill the cars with the material piled in the hall and\nto proceed to Pordenone. The mechanics were gone already. I went out\nback to the garage. The other two cars came in while I was there and\ntheir drivers got down. It was starting to rain again.\n\n“I’m so —— sleepy I went to sleep three times coming here from Plava,”\nPiani said. “What are we going to do, Tenente?”\n\n“We’ll change the oil, grease them, fill them up, then take them around\nin front and load up the junk they’ve left.”\n\n“Then do we start?”\n\n“No, we’ll sleep for three hours.”\n\n“Christ I’m glad to sleep,” Bonello said. “I couldn’t keep awake\ndriving.”\n\n“How’s your car, Aymo?” I asked.\n\n“It’s all right.”\n\n“Get me a monkey suit and I’ll help you with the oil.”\n\n“Don’t you do that, Tenente,” Aymo said. “It’s nothing to do. You go and\npack your things.”\n\n“My things are all packed,” I said. “I’ll go and carry out the stuff\nthat they left for us. Bring the cars around as soon as they’re ready.”\n\nThey brought the cars around to the front of the villa and we loaded\nthem with the hospital equipment which was piled in the hallway. When it\nwas all in, the three cars stood in line down the driveway under the\ntrees in the rain. We went inside.\n\n“Make a fire in the kitchen and dry your things,” I said.\n\n“I don’t care about dry clothes,” Piani said. “I want to sleep.”\n\n“I’m going to sleep on the major’s bed,” Bonello said. “I’m going to\nsleep where the old man corks off.”\n\n“I don’t care where I sleep,” Piani said.\n\n“There are two beds in here.” I opened the door.\n\n“I never knew what was in that room,” Bonello said.\n\n“That was old fish-face’s room,” Piani said.\n\n“You two sleep in there,” I said. “I’ll wake you.”\n\n“The Austrians will wake us if you sleep too long, Tenente,” Bonello\nsaid.\n\n“I won’t oversleep,” I said. “Where’s Aymo?”\n\n“He went out in the kitchen.”\n\n“Get to sleep,” I said.\n\n“I’ll sleep,” Piani said. “I’ve been asleep sitting up all day. The\nwhole top of my head kept coming down over my eyes.”\n\n“Take your boots off,” Bonello said. “That’s old fish-face’s bed.”\n\n“Fish-face is nothing to me.” Piani lay on the bed, his muddy boots\nstraight out, his head on his arm. I went out to the kitchen. Aymo had a\nfire in the stove and a kettle of water on.\n\n“I thought I’d start some _pasta asciutta_,” he said. “We’ll be hungry\nwhen we wake up.”\n\n“Aren’t you sleepy, Bartolomeo?”\n\n“Not so sleepy. When the water boils I’ll leave it. The fire will go\ndown.”\n\n“You’d better get some sleep,” I said. “We can eat cheese and monkey\nmeat.”\n\n“This is better,” he said. “Something hot will be good for those two\nanarchists. You go to sleep, Tenente.”\n\n“There’s a bed in the major’s room.”\n\n“You sleep there.”\n\n“No, I’m going up to my old room. Do you want a drink, Bartolomeo?”\n\n“When we go, Tenente. Now it wouldn’t do me any good.”\n\n“If you wake in three hours and I haven’t called you, wake me, will\nyou?”\n\n“I haven’t any watch, Tenente.”\n\n“There’s a clock on the wall in the major’s room.”\n\n“All right.”"}
{"text": "I went out then through the dining-room and the hall and up the marble\nstairs to the room where I had lived with Rinaldi. It was raining\noutside. I went to the window and looked out. It was getting dark and I\nsaw the three cars standing in line under the trees. The trees were\ndripping in the rain. It was cold and the drops hung to the branches. I\nwent back to Rinaldi’s bed and lay down and let sleep take me.\n\nWe ate in the kitchen before we started. Aymo had a basin of spaghetti\nwith onions and tinned meat chopped up in it. We sat around the table\nand drank two bottles of the wine that had been left in the cellar of\nthe villa. It was dark outside and still raining. Piani sat at the table\nvery sleepy.\n\n“I like a retreat better than an advance,” Bonello said. “On a retreat\nwe drink barbera.”\n\n“We drink it now. To-morrow maybe we drink rain-water,” Aymo said.\n\n“To-morrow we’ll be in Udine. We’ll drink champagne. That’s where the\nslackers live. Wake up, Piani! We’ll drink champagne to-morrow in\nUdine!”\n\n“I’m awake,” Piani said. He filled his plate with the spaghetti and\nmeat. “Couldn’t you find tomato sauce, Barto?”\n\n“There wasn’t any,” Aymo said.\n\n“We’ll drink champagne in Udine,” Bonello said. He filled his glass with\nthe clear red barbera.\n\n“We may drink —— before Udine,” Piani said.\n\n“Have you eaten enough, Tenente?” Aymo asked.\n\n“I’ve got plenty. Give me the bottle, Bartolomeo.”\n\n“I have a bottle apiece to take in the cars,” Aymo said.\n\n“Did you sleep at all?”\n\n“I don’t need much sleep. I slept a little.”\n\n“To-morrow we’ll sleep in the king’s bed,” Bonello said. He was feeling\nvery good.\n\n“To-morrow maybe we’ll sleep in ——,” Piani said.\n\n“I’ll sleep with the queen,” Bonello said. He looked to see how I took\nthe joke.\n\n“You’ll sleep with ——,” Piani said sleepily.\n\n“That’s treason, Tenente,” Bonello said. “Isn’t that treason?”\n\n“Shut up,” I said. “You get too funny with a little wine.” Outside it\nwas raining hard. I looked at my watch. It was half-past nine.\n\n“It’s time to roll,” I said and stood up.\n\n“Who are you going to ride with, Tenente?” Bonello asked.\n\n“With Aymo. Then you come. Then Piani. We’ll start out on the road for\nCormons.”\n\n“I’m afraid I’ll go to sleep,” Piani said.\n\n“All right. I’ll ride with you. Then Bonello. Then Aymo.”\n\n“That’s the best way,” Piani said. “Because I’m so sleepy.”\n\n“I’ll drive and you sleep awhile.”\n\n“No. I can drive just so long as I know somebody will wake me up if I go\nto sleep.”\n\n“I’ll wake you up. Put out the lights, Barto.”\n\n“You might as well leave them,” Bonello said. “We’ve got no more use for\nthis place.”\n\n“I have a small locker trunk in my room,” I said. “Will you help take it\ndown, Piani?”\n\n“We’ll take it,” Piani said. “Come on, Aldo.” He went off into the hall\nwith Bonello. I heard them going upstairs.\n\n“This was a fine place,” Bartolomeo Aymo said. He put two bottles of\nwine and half a cheese into his haversack. “There won’t be a place like\nthis again. Where will they retreat to, Tenente?”\n\n“Beyond the Tagliamento, they say. The hospital and the sector are to be\nat Pordenone.”\n\n“This is a better town than Pordenone.”\n\n“I don’t know Pordenone,” I said. “I’ve just been through there.”\n\n“It’s not much of a place,” Aymo said."}
{"text": "As we moved out through the town it was empty in the rain and the dark\nexcept for columns of troops and guns that were going through the main\nstreet. There were many trucks too and some carts going through on other\nstreets and converging on the main road. When we were out past the\ntanneries onto the main road the troops, the motor trucks, the\nhorse-drawn carts and the guns were in one wide slow-moving column. We\nmoved slowly but steadily in the rain, the radiator cap of our car\nalmost against the tailboard of a truck that was loaded high, the load\ncovered with wet canvas. Then the truck stopped. The whole column was\nstopped. It started again and we went a little farther, then stopped. I\ngot out and walked ahead, going between the trucks and carts and under\nthe wet necks of the horses. The block was farther ahead. I left the\nroad, crossed the ditch on a footboard and walked along the field beyond\nthe ditch. I could see the stalled column between the trees in the rain\nas I went forward across from it in the field. I went about a mile. The\ncolumn did not move, although, on the other side beyond the stalled\nvehicles I could see the troops moving. I went back to the cars. This\nblock might extend as far as Udine. Piani was asleep over the wheel. I\nclimbed up beside him and went to sleep too. Several hours later I heard\nthe truck ahead of us grinding into gear. I woke Piani and we started,\nmoving a few yards, then stopping, then going on again. It was still\nraining.\n\nThe column stalled again in the night and did not start. I got down and\nwent back to see Aymo and Bonello. Bonello had two sergeants of\nengineers on the seat of his car with him. They stiffened when I came\nup.\n\n“They were left to do something to a bridge,” Bonello said. “They can’t\nfind their unit so I gave them a ride.”\n\n“With the Sir Lieutenant’s permission.”\n\n“With permission,” I said.\n\n“The lieutenant is an American,” Bonello said. “He’ll give anybody a\nride.”\n\nOne of the sergeants smiled. The other asked Bonello if I was an Italian\nfrom North or South America.\n\n“He’s not an Italian. He’s North American English.”\n\nThe sergeants were polite but did not believe it. I left them and went\nback to Aymo. He had two girls on the seat with him and was sitting back\nin the corner and smoking.\n\n“Barto, Barto,” I said. He laughed.\n\n“Talk to them, Tenente,” he said. “I can’t understand them. Hey!” he put\nhis hand on the girl’s thigh and squeezed it in a friendly way. The girl\ndrew her shawl tight around her and pushed his hand away. “Hey!” he\nsaid. “Tell the Tenente your name and what you’re doing here.”\n\nThe girl looked at me fiercely. The other girl kept her eyes down. The\ngirl who looked at me said something in a dialect I could not understand\na word of. She was plump and dark and looked about sixteen.\n\n“Sorella?” I asked and pointed at the other girl.\n\nShe nodded her head and smiled.\n\n“All right,” I said and patted her knee. I felt her stiffen away when I\ntouched her. The sister never looked up. She looked perhaps a year\nyounger. Aymo put his hand on the elder girl’s thigh and she pushed it\naway. He laughed at her.\n\n“Good man,” he pointed at himself. “Good man,” he pointed at me. “Don’t\nyou worry.” The girl looked at him fiercely. The pair of them were like\ntwo wild birds.\n\n“What does she ride with me for if she doesn’t like me?” Aymo asked.\n“They got right up in the car the minute I motioned to them.” He turned\nto the girl. “Don’t worry,” he said. “No danger of ——,” using the\nvulgar word. “No place for ——.” I could see she understood the word\nand that was all. Her eyes looked at him very scared. She pulled the\nshawl tight. “Car all full,” Aymo said. “No danger of ——. No place for\n——.” Every time he said the word the girl stiffened a little. Then\nsitting stiffly and looking at him she began to cry. I saw her lips\nworking and then tears came down her plump cheeks. Her sister, not\nlooking up, took her hand and they sat there together. The older one,\nwho had been so fierce, began to sob.\n\n“I guess I scared her,” Aymo said. “I didn’t mean to scare her.”"}
{"text": "Bartolomeo brought out his knapsack and cut off two pieces of cheese.\n“Here,” he said. “Stop crying.”\n\nThe older girl shook her head and still cried, but the younger girl took\nthe cheese and commenced to eat. After a while the younger girl gave her\nsister the second piece of cheese and they both ate. The older sister\nstill sobbed a little.\n\n“She’ll be all right after a while,” Aymo said.\n\nAn idea came to him. “Virgin?” he asked the girl next to him. She nodded\nher head vigorously. “Virgin too?” he pointed to the sister. Both the\ngirls nodded their heads and the elder said something in dialect.\n\n“That’s all right,” Bartolomeo said. “That’s all right.”\n\nBoth the girls seemed cheered.\n\nI left them sitting together with Aymo sitting back in the corner and\nwent back to Piani’s car. The column of vehicles did not move but the\ntroops kept passing alongside. It was still raining hard and I thought\nsome of the stops in the movement of the column might be from cars with\nwet wiring. More likely they were from horses or men going to sleep.\nStill, traffic could tie up in cities when every one was awake. It was\nthe combination of horse and motor vehicles. They did not help each\nother any. The peasants’ carts did not help much either. Those were a\ncouple of fine girls with Barto. A retreat was no place for two virgins.\nReal virgins. Probably very religious. If there were no war we would\nprobably all be in bed. In bed I lay me down my head. Bed and board.\nStiff as a board in bed. Catherine was in bed now between two sheets,\nover her and under her. Which side did she sleep on? Maybe she wasn’t\nasleep. Maybe she was lying thinking about me. Blow, blow, ye western\nwind. Well, it blew and it wasn’t the small rain but the big rain down\nthat rained. It rained all night. You knew it rained down that rained.\nLook at it. Christ, that my love were in my arms and I in my bed again.\nThat my love Catherine. That my sweet love Catherine down might rain.\nBlow her again to me. Well, we were in it. Every one was caught in it\nand the small rain would not quiet it. “Good-night, Catherine,” I said\nout loud. “I hope you sleep well. If it’s too uncomfortable, darling,\nlie on the other side,” I said. “I’ll get you some cold water. In a\nlittle while it will be morning and then it won’t be so bad. I’m sorry\nhe makes you so uncomfortable. Try and go to sleep, sweet.”\n\nI was asleep all the time, she said. You’ve been talking in your sleep.\nAre you all right?\n\nAre you really there?\n\nOf course I’m here. I wouldn’t go way. This doesn’t make any difference\nbetween us.\n\nYou’re so lovely and sweet. You wouldn’t go away in the night, would\nyou?\n\nOf course I wouldn’t go away. I’m always here. I come whenever you want\nme.\n\n“——,” Piani said. “They’ve started again.”\n\n“I was dopey,” I said. I looked at my watch. It was three o’clock in the\nmorning. I reached back behind the seat for a bottle of the barbera.\n\n“You talked out loud,” Piani said.\n\n“I was having a dream in English,” I said.\n\nThe rain was slacking and we were moving along. Before daylight we were\nstalled again and when it was light we were at a little rise in the\nground and I saw the road of the retreat stretched out far ahead,\neverything stationary except for the infantry filtering through. We\nstarted to move again but seeing the rate of progress in the daylight, I\nknew we were going to have to get off that main road some way and go\nacross country if we ever hoped to reach Udine."}
{"text": "In the night many peasants had joined the column from the roads of the\ncountry and in the column there were carts loaded with household goods;\nthere were mirrors projecting up between mattresses, and chickens and\nducks tied to carts. There was a sewing-machine on the cart ahead of us\nin the rain. They had saved the most valuable things. On some carts the\nwomen sat huddled from the rain and others walked beside the carts\nkeeping as close to them as they could. There were dogs now in the\ncolumn, keeping under the wagons as they moved along. The road was\nmuddy, the ditches at the side were high with water and beyond the trees\nthat lined the road the fields looked too wet and too soggy to try to\ncross. I got down from the car and worked up the road a way, looking for\na place where I could see ahead to find a side-road we could take across\ncountry. I knew there were many side-roads but did not want one that\nwould lead to nothing. I could not remember them because we had always\npassed them bowling along in the car on the main road and they all\nlooked much alike. Now I knew we must find one if we hoped to get\nthrough. No one knew where the Austrians were nor how things were going\nbut I was certain that if the rain should stop and planes come over and\nget to work on that column that it would be all over. All that was\nneeded was for a few men to leave their trucks or a few horses be killed\nto tie up completely the movement on the road.\n\nThe rain was not falling so heavily now and I thought it might clear. I\nwent ahead along the edge of the road and when there was a small road\nthat led off to the north between two fields with a hedge of trees on\nboth sides, I thought that we had better take it and hurried back to the\ncars. I told Piani to turn off and went back to tell Bonello and Aymo.\n\n“If it leads nowhere we can turn around and cut back in,” I said.\n\n“What about these?” Bonello asked. His two sergeants were beside him on\nthe seat. They were unshaven but still military looking in the early\nmorning.\n\n“They’ll be good to push,” I said. I went back to Aymo and told him we\nwere going to try it across country.\n\n“What about my virgin family?” Aymo asked. The two girls were asleep.\n\n“They won’t be very useful,” I said. “You ought to have some one that\ncould push.”\n\n“They could go back in the car,” Aymo said. “There’s room in the car.”\n\n“All right if you want them,” I said. “Pick up somebody with a wide back\nto push.”\n\n“Bersaglieri,” Aymo smiled. “They have the widest backs. They measure\nthem. How do you feel, Tenente?”\n\n“Fine. How are you?”\n\n“Fine. But very hungry.”\n\n“There ought to be something up that road and we will stop and eat.”\n\n“How’s your leg, Tenente?”\n\n“Fine,” I said. Standing on the step and looking up ahead I could see\nPiani’s car pulling out onto the little side-road and starting up it,\nhis car showing through the hedge of bare branches. Bonello turned off\nand followed him and then Piani worked his way out and we followed the\ntwo ambulances ahead along the narrow road between hedges. It led to a\nfarmhouse. We found Piani and Bonello stopped in the farmyard. The house\nwas low and long with a trellis with a grape-vine over the door. There\nwas a well in the yard and Piani was getting up water to fill his\nradiator. So much going in low gear had boiled it out. The farmhouse was\ndeserted. I looked back down the road, the farmhouse was on a slight\nelevation above the plain, and we could see over the country, and saw\nthe road, the hedges, the fields and the line of trees along the main\nroad where the retreat was passing. The two sergeants were looking\nthrough the house. The girls were awake and looking at the courtyard,\nthe well and the two big ambulances in front of the farmhouse, with\nthree drivers at the well. One of the sergeants came out with a clock in\nhis hand.\n\n“Put it back,” I said. He looked at me, went in the house and came back\nwithout the clock.\n\n“Where’s your partner?” I asked.\n\n“He’s gone to the latrine.” He got up on the seat of the ambulance. He\nwas afraid we would leave him."}
{"text": "“What about breakfast, Tenente?” Bonello asked. “We could eat something.\nIt wouldn’t take very long.”\n\n“Do you think this road going down on the other side will lead to\nanything?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“All right. Let’s eat.” Piani and Bonello went in the house.\n\n“Come on,” Aymo said to the girls. He held his hand to help them down.\nThe older sister shook her head. They were not going into any deserted\nhouse. They looked after us.\n\n“They are difficult,” Aymo said. We went into the farmhouse together. It\nwas large and dark, an abandoned feeling. Bonello and Piani were in the\nkitchen.\n\n“There’s not much to eat,” Piani said. “They’ve cleaned it out.”\n\nBonello sliced a big white cheese on the heavy kitchen table.\n\n“Where was the cheese?”\n\n“In the cellar. Piani found wine too and apples.”\n\n“That’s a good breakfast.”\n\nPiani was taking the wooden cork out of a big wicker-covered wine jug.\nHe tipped it and poured a copper pan full.\n\n“It smells all right,” he said. “Find some beakers, Barto.”\n\nThe two sergeants came in.\n\n“Have some cheese, sergeants,” Bonello said.\n\n“We should go,” one of the sergeants said, eating his cheese and\ndrinking a cup of wine.\n\n“We’ll go. Don’t worry,” Bonello said.\n\n“An army travels on its stomach,” I said.\n\n“What?” asked the sergeant.\n\n“It’s better to eat.”\n\n“Yes. But time is precious.”\n\n“I believe the bastards have eaten already,” Piani said. The sergeants\nlooked at him. They hated the lot of us.\n\n“You know the road?” one of them asked me.\n\n“No,” I said. They looked at each other.\n\n“We would do best to start,” the first one said.\n\n“We are starting,” I said. I drank another cup of the red wine. It\ntasted very good after the cheese and apple.\n\n“Bring the cheese,” I said and went out. Bonello came out carrying the\ngreat jug of wine.\n\n“That’s too big,” I said. He looked at it regretfully.\n\n“I guess it is,” he said. “Give me the canteens to fill.” He filled the\ncanteens and some of the wine ran out on the stone paving of the\ncourtyard. Then he picked up the wine jug and put it just inside the\ndoor.\n\n“The Austrians can find it without breaking the door down,” he said.\n\n“We’ll roll,” I said. “Piani and I will go ahead.” The two engineers\nwere already on the seat beside Bonello. The girls were eating cheese\nand apples. Aymo was smoking. We started off down the narrow road. I\nlooked back at the two cars coming and the farmhouse. It was a fine,\nlow, solid stone house and the ironwork of the well was very good. Ahead\nof us the road was narrow and muddy and there was a high hedge on either\nside. Behind, the cars were following closely.\n\nAt noon we were stuck in a muddy road about, as nearly as we could\nfigure, ten kilometres from Udine. The rain had stopped during the\nforenoon and three times we had heard planes coming, seen them pass\noverhead, watched them go far to the left and heard them bombing on the\nmain highroad. We had worked through a network of secondary roads and\nhad taken many roads that were blind, but had always, by backing up and\nfinding another road, gotten closer to Udine. Now, Aymo’s car, in\nbacking so that we might get out of a blind road, had gotten into the\nsoft earth at the side and the wheels, spinning, had dug deeper and\ndeeper until the car rested on its differential. The thing to do now was\nto dig out in front of the wheels, put in brush so that the chains could\ngrip, and then push until the car was on the road. We were all down on\nthe road around the car. The two sergeants looked at the car and\nexamined the wheels. Then they started off down the road without a word.\nI went after them.\n\n“Come on,” I said. “Cut some brush.”\n\n“We have to go,” one said.\n\n“Get busy,” I said, “and cut brush.”\n\n“We have to go,” one said. The other said nothing. They were in a hurry\nto start. They would not look at me.\n\n“I order you to come back to the car and cut brush,” I said. The one\nsergeant turned. “We have to go on. In a little while you will be cut\noff. You can’t order us. You’re not our officer.”\n\n“I order you to cut brush,” I said. They turned and started down the\nroad."}
{"text": "“Halt,” I said. They kept on down the muddy road, the hedge on either\nside. “I order you to halt,” I called. They went a little faster. I\nopened up my holster, took the pistol, aimed at the one who had talked\nthe most, and fired. I missed and they both started to run. I shot three\ntimes and dropped one. The other went through the hedge and was out of\nsight. I fired at him through the hedge as he ran across the field. The\npistol clicked empty and I put in another clip. I saw it was too far to\nshoot at the second sergeant. He was far across the field, running, his\nhead held low. I commenced to reload the empty clip. Bonello came up.\n\n“Let me go finish him,” he said. I handed him the pistol and he walked\ndown to where the sergeant of engineers lay face down across the road.\nBonello leaned over, put the pistol against the man’s head and pulled\nthe trigger. The pistol did not fire.\n\n“You have to cock it,” I said. He cocked it and fired twice. He took\nhold of the sergeant’s legs and pulled him to the side of the road so he\nlay beside the hedge. He came back and handed me the pistol.\n\n“The son of a bitch,” he said. He looked toward the sergeant. “You see\nme shoot him, Tenente?”\n\n“We’ve got to get the brush quickly,” I said. “Did I hit the other one\nat all?”\n\n“I don’t think so,” Aymo said. “He was too far away to hit with a\npistol.”\n\n“The dirty scum,” Piani said. We were all cutting twigs and branches.\nEverything had been taken out of the car. Bonello was digging out in\nfront of the wheels. When we were ready Aymo started the car and put it\ninto gear. The wheels spun round throwing brush and mud. Bonello and I\npushed until we could feel our joints crack. The car would not move.\n\n“Rock her back and forth, Barto,” I said.\n\nHe drove the engine in reverse, then forward. The wheels only dug in\ndeeper. Then the car was resting on the differential again, and the\nwheels spun freely in the holes they had dug. I straightened up.\n\n“We’ll try her with a rope,” I said.\n\n“I don’t think it’s any use, Tenente. You can’t get a straight pull.”\n\n“We have to try it,” I said. “She won’t come out any other way.”\n\nPiani’s and Bonello’s cars could only move straight ahead down the\nnarrow road. We roped both cars together and pulled. The wheels only\npulled sideways against the ruts.\n\n“It’s no good,” I shouted. “Stop it.”\n\nPiani and Bonello got down from their cars and came back. Aymo got down.\nThe girls were up the road about forty yards sitting on a stone wall.\n\n“What do you say, Tenente?” Bonello asked.\n\n“We’ll dig out and try once more with the brush,” I said. I looked down\nthe road. It was my fault. I had led them up here. The sun was almost\nout from behind the clouds and the body of the sergeant lay beside the\nhedge.\n\n“We’ll put his coat and cape under,” I said. Bonello went to get them. I\ncut brush and Aymo and Piani dug out in front and between the wheels. I\ncut the cape, then ripped it in two, and laid it under the wheel in the\nmud, then piled brush for the wheels to catch. We were ready to start\nand Aymo got up on the seat and started the car. The wheels spun and we\npushed and pushed. But it wasn’t any use.\n\n“It’s ——ed,” I said. “Is there anything you want in the car, Barto?”\n\nAymo climbed up with Bonello, carrying the cheese and two bottles of\nwine and his cape. Bonello, sitting behind the wheel, was looking\nthrough the pockets of the sergeant’s coat.\n\n“Better throw the coat away,” I said. “What about Barto’s virgins?”\n\n“They can get in the back,” Piani said. “I don’t think we are going\nfar.”\n\nI opened the back door of the ambulance."}
{"text": "“Come on,” I said. “Get in.” The two girls climbed in and sat in the\ncorner. They seemed to have taken no notice of the shooting. I looked\nback up the road. The sergeant lay in his dirty long-sleeved underwear.\nI got up with Piani and we started. We were going to try to cross the\nfield. When the road entered the field I got down and walked ahead. If\nwe could get across, there was a road on the other side. We could not\nget across. It was too soft and muddy for the cars. When they were\nfinally and completely stalled, the wheels dug in to the hubs, we left\nthem in the field and started on foot for Udine.\n\nWhen we came to the road which led back toward the main highway I\npointed down it to the two girls.\n\n“Go down there,” I said. “You’ll meet people.” They looked at me. I took\nout my pocket-book and gave them each a ten-lira note. “Go down there,”\nI said, pointing. “Friends! Family!”\n\nThey did not understand but they held the money tightly and started down\nthe road. They looked back as though they were afraid I might take the\nmoney back. I watched them go down the road, their shawls close around\nthem, looking back apprehensively at us. The three drivers were\nlaughing.\n\n“How much will you give me to go in that direction, Tenente?” Bonello\nasked.\n\n“They’re better off in a bunch of people than alone if they catch them,”\nI said.\n\n“Give me two hundred lire and I’ll walk straight back toward Austria,”\nBonello said.\n\n“They’d take it away from you,” Piani said.\n\n“Maybe the war will be over,” Aymo said. We were going up the road as\nfast as we could. The sun was trying to come through. Beside the road\nwere mulberry trees. Through the trees I could see our two big\nmoving-vans of cars stuck in the field. Piani looked back too.\n\n“They’ll have to build a road to get them out,” he said.\n\n“I wish to Christ we had bicycles,” Bonello said.\n\n“Do they ride bicycles in America?” Aymo asked.\n\n“They used to.”\n\n“Here it is a great thing,” Aymo said. “A bicycle is a splendid thing.”\n\n“I wish to Christ we had bicycles,” Bonello said. “I’m no walker.”\n\n“Is that firing?” I asked. I thought I could hear firing a long way\naway.\n\n“I don’t know,” Aymo said. He listened.\n\n“I think so,” I said.\n\n“The first thing we will see will be the cavalry,” Piani said.\n\n“I don’t think they’ve got any cavalry.”\n\n“I hope to Christ not,” Bonello said. “I don’t want to be stuck on a\nlance by any —— cavalry.”\n\n“You certainly shot that sergeant, Tenente,” Piani said. We were walking\nfast.\n\n“I killed him,” Bonello said. “I never killed anybody in this war, and\nall my life I’ve wanted to kill a sergeant.”\n\n“You killed him on the sit all right,” Piani said. “He wasn’t flying\nvery fast when you killed him.”\n\n“Never mind. That’s one thing I can always remember. I killed that ——\nof a sergeant.”\n\n“What will you say in confession?” Aymo asked.\n\n“I’ll say, ‘Bless me, father, I killed a sergeant.’” They all laughed.\n\n“He’s an anarchist,” Piani said. “He doesn’t go to church.”\n\n“Piani’s an anarchist too,” Bonello said.\n\n“Are you really anarchists?” I asked.\n\n“No, Tenente. We’re socialists. We come from Imola.”\n\n“Haven’t you ever been there?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“By Christ it’s a fine place, Tenente. You come there after the war and\nwe’ll show you something.”\n\n“Are you all socialists?”\n\n“Everybody.”\n\n“Is it a fine town?”\n\n“Wonderful. You never saw a town like that.”\n\n“How did you get to be socialists?”\n\n“We’re all socialists. Everybody is a socialist. We’ve always been\nsocialists.”\n\n“You come, Tenente. We’ll make you a socialist too.”\n\nAhead the road turned off to the left and there was a little hill and,\nbeyond a stone wall, an apple orchard. As the road went uphill they\nceased talking. We walked along together all going fast against time."}
{"text": "Later we were on a road that led to a river. There was a long line of\nabandoned trucks and carts on the road leading up to the bridge. No one\nwas in sight. The river was high and the bridge had been blown up in the\ncentre; the stone arch was fallen into the river and the brown water was\ngoing over it. We went on up the bank looking for a place to cross. Up\nahead I knew there was a railway bridge and I thought we might be able\nto get across there. The path was wet and muddy. We did not see any\ntroops; only abandoned trucks and stores. Along the river bank there was\nnothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy ground. We went up to the\nbank and finally we saw the railway bridge.\n\n“What a beautiful bridge,” Aymo said. It was a long plain iron bridge\nacross what was usually a dry river-bed.\n\n“We better hurry and get across before they blow it up,” I said.\n\n“There’s nobody to blow it up,” Piani said. “They’re all gone.”\n\n“It’s probably mined,” Bonello said. “You cross first, Tenente.”\n\n“Listen to the anarchist,” Aymo said. “Make him go first.”\n\n“I’ll go,” I said. “It won’t be mined to blow up with one man.”\n\n“You see,” Piani said. “That is brains. Why haven’t you brains,\nanarchist?”\n\n“If I had brains I wouldn’t be here,” Bonello said.\n\n“That’s pretty good, Tenente,” Aymo said.\n\n“That’s pretty good,” I said. We were close to the bridge now. The sky\nhad clouded over again and it was raining a little. The bridge looked\nlong and solid. We climbed up the embankment.\n\n“Come one at a time,” I said and started across the bridge. I watched\nthe ties and the rails for any tripwires or signs of explosive but I saw\nnothing. Down below the gaps in the ties the river ran muddy and fast.\nAhead across the wet countryside I could see Udine in the rain. Across\nthe bridge I looked back. Just up the river was another bridge. As I\nwatched, a yellow mud-colored motor car crossed it. The sides of the\nbridge were high and the body of the car, once on, was out of sight. But\nI saw the heads of the driver, the man on the seat with him, and the two\nmen on the rear seat. They all wore German helmets. Then the car was\nover the bridge and out of sight behind the trees and the abandoned\nvehicles on the road. I waved to Aymo who was crossing and to the others\nto come on. I climbed down and crouched beside the railway embankment.\nAymo came down with me.\n\n“Did you see the car?” I asked.\n\n“No. We were watching you.”\n\n“A German staff car crossed on the upper bridge.”\n\n“A staff car?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Holy Mary.”\n\nThe others came and we all crouched in the mud behind the embankment,\nlooking across the rails at the bridge, the line of trees, the ditch and\nthe road.\n\n“Do you think we’re cut off then, Tenente?”\n\n“I don’t know. All I know is a German staff car went along that road.”\n\n“You don’t feel funny, Tenente? You haven’t got strange feelings in the\nhead?”\n\n“Don’t be funny, Bonello.”\n\n“What about a drink?” Piani asked. “If we’re cut off we might as well\nhave a drink.” He unhooked his canteen and uncorked it.\n\n“Look! Look!” Aymo said and pointed toward the road. Along the top of\nthe stone bridge we could see German helmets moving. They were bent\nforward and moved smoothly, almost supernaturally, along. As they came\noff the bridge we saw them. They were bicycle troops. I saw the faces of\nthe first two. They were ruddy and healthy-looking. Their helmets came\nlow down over their foreheads and the side of their faces. Their\ncarbines were clipped to the frame of the bicycles. Stick bombs hung\nhandle down from their belts. Their helmets and their gray uniforms were\nwet and they rode easily, looking ahead and to both sides. There were\ntwo—then four in line, then two, then almost a dozen; then another\ndozen—then one alone. They did not talk but we could not have heard\nthem because of the noise from the river. They were gone out of sight up\nthe road.\n\n“Holy Mary,” Aymo said.\n\n“They were Germans,” Piani said. “Those weren’t Austrians.”\n\n“Why isn’t there somebody here to stop them?” I said. “Why haven’t they\nblown the bridge up? Why aren’t there machine-guns along this\nembankment?”\n\n“You tell us, Tenente,” Bonello said.\n\nI was very angry."}
{"text": "“The whole bloody thing is crazy. Down below they blow up a little\nbridge. Here they leave a bridge on the main road. Where is everybody?\nDon’t they try and stop them at all?”\n\n“You tell us, Tenente,” Bonello said. I shut up. It was none of my\nbusiness; all I had to do was to get to Pordenone with three ambulances.\nI had failed at that. All I had to do now was get to Pordenone. I\nprobably could not even get to Udine. The hell I couldn’t. The thing to\ndo was to be calm and not get shot or captured.\n\n“Didn’t you have a canteen open?” I asked Piani. He handed it to me. I\ntook a long drink. “We might as well start,” I said. “There’s no hurry\nthough. Do you want to eat something?”\n\n“This is no place to stay,” Bonello said.\n\n“All right. We’ll start.”\n\n“Should we keep on this side—out of sight?”\n\n“We’ll be better off on top. They may come along this bridge too. We\ndon’t want them on top of us before we see them.”\n\nWe walked along the railroad track. On both sides of us stretched the\nwet plain. Ahead across the plain was the hill of Udine. The roofs fell\naway from the castle on the hill. We could see the campanile and the\nclock-tower. There were many mulberry trees in the fields. Ahead I saw a\nplace where the rails were torn up. The ties had been dug out too and\nthrown down the embankment.\n\n“Down! down!” Aymo said. We dropped down beside the embankment. There\nwas another group of bicyclists passing along the road. I looked over\nthe edge and saw them go on.\n\n“They saw us but they went on,” Aymo said.\n\n“We’ll get killed up there, Tenente,” Bonello said.\n\n“They don’t want us,” I said. “They’re after something else. We’re in\nmore danger if they should come on us suddenly.”\n\n“I’d rather walk here out of sight,” Bonello said.\n\n“All right. We’ll walk along the tracks.”\n\n“Do you think we can get through?” Aymo asked.\n\n“Sure. There aren’t very many of them yet. We’ll go through in the\ndark.”\n\n“What was that staff car doing?”\n\n“Christ knows,” I said. We kept on up the tracks. Bonello tired of\nwalking in the mud of the embankment and came up with the rest of us.\nThe railway moved south away from the highway now and we could not see\nwhat passed along the road. A short bridge over a canal was blown up but\nwe climbed across on what was left of the span. We heard firing ahead of\nus.\n\nWe came up on the railway beyond the canal. It went on straight toward\nthe town across the low fields. We could see the line of the other\nrailway ahead of us. To the north was the main road where we had seen\nthe cyclists; to the south there was a small branch-road across the\nfields with thick trees on each side. I thought we had better cut to the\nsouth and work around the town that way and across country toward\nCampoformio and the main road to the Tagliamento. We could avoid the\nmain line of the retreat by keeping to the secondary roads beyond Udine.\nI knew there were plenty of side-roads across the plain. I started down\nthe embankment.\n\n“Come on,” I said. We would make for the side-road and work to the south\nof the town. We all started down the embankment. A shot was fired at us\nfrom the side-road. The bullet went into the mud of the embankment.\n\n“Go on back,” I shouted. I started up the embankment, slipping in the\nmud. The drivers were ahead of me. I went up the embankment as fast as I\ncould go. Two more shots came from the thick brush and Aymo, as he was\ncrossing the tracks, lurched, tripped and fell face down. We pulled him\ndown on the other side and turned him over. “His head ought to be\nuphill,” I said. Piani moved him around. He lay in the mud on the side\nof the embankment, his feet pointing downhill, breathing blood\nirregularly. The three of us squatted over him in the rain. He was hit\nlow in the back of the neck and the bullet had ranged upward and come\nout under the right eye. He died while I was stopping up the two holes.\nPiani laid his head down, wiped at his face, with a piece of the\nemergency dressing, then let it alone.\n\n“The ——,” he said.\n\n“They weren’t Germans,” I said. “There can’t be any Germans over there.”"}
{"text": "“Italians,” Piani said, using the word as an epithet, “Italiani!”\nBonello said nothing. He was sitting beside Aymo, not looking at him.\nPiani picked up Aymo’s cap where it had rolled down the embankment and\nput it over his face. He took out his canteen.\n\n“Do you want a drink?” Piani handed Bonello the canteen.\n\n“No,” Bonello said. He turned to me. “That might have happened to us any\ntime on the railway tracks.”\n\n“No,” I said. “It was because we started across the field.”\n\nBonello shook his head. “Aymo’s dead,” he said. “Who’s dead next,\nTenente? Where do we go now?”\n\n“Those were Italians that shot,” I said. “They weren’t Germans.”\n\n“I suppose if they were Germans they’d have killed all of us,” Bonello\nsaid.\n\n“We are in more danger from Italians than Germans,” I said. “The rear\nguard are afraid of everything. The Germans know what they’re after.”\n\n“You reason it out, Tenente,” Bonello said.\n\n“Where do we go now?” Piani asked.\n\n“We better lie up some place till it’s dark. If we could get south we’d\nbe all right.”\n\n“They’d have to shoot us all to prove they were right the first time,”\nBonello said. “I’m not going to try them.”\n\n“We’ll find a place to lie up as near to Udine as we can get and then go\nthrough when it’s dark.”\n\n“Let’s go then,” Bonello said. We went down the north side of the\nembankment. I looked back. Aymo lay in the mud with the angle of the\nembankment. He was quite small and his arms were by his side, his\nputtee-wrapped legs and muddy boots together, his cap over his face. He\nlooked very dead. It was raining. I had liked him as well as any one I\never knew. I had his papers in my pocket and would write to his family.\nAhead across the fields was a farmhouse. There were trees around it and\nthe farm buildings were built against the house. There was a balcony\nalong the second floor held up by columns.\n\n“We better keep a little way apart,” I said. “I’ll go ahead.” I started\ntoward the farmhouse. There was a path across the field.\n\nCrossing the field, I did not know but that some one would fire on us\nfrom the trees near the farmhouse or from the farmhouse itself. I walked\ntoward it, seeing it very clearly. The balcony of the second floor\nmerged into the barn and there was hay coming out between the columns.\nThe courtyard was of stone blocks and all the trees were dripping with\nthe rain. There was a big empty two-wheeled cart, the shafts tipped high\nup in the rain. I came to the courtyard, crossed it, and stood under the\nshelter of the balcony. The door of the house was open and I went in.\nBonello and Piani came in after me. It was dark inside. I went back to\nthe kitchen. There were ashes of a fire on the big open hearth. The pots\nhung over the ashes, but they were empty. I looked around but I could\nnot find anything to eat.\n\n“We ought to lie up in the barn,” I said. “Do you think you could find\nanything to eat, Piani, and bring it up there?”\n\n“I’ll look,” Piani said.\n\n“I’ll look too,” Bonello said."}
{"text": "“All right,” I said. “I’ll go up and look at the barn.” I found a stone\nstairway that went up from the stable underneath. The stable smelt dry\nand pleasant in the rain. The cattle were all gone, probably driven off\nwhen they left. The barn was half full of hay. There were two windows in\nthe roof, one was blocked with boards, the other was a narrow dormer\nwindow on the north side. There was a chute so that hay might be pitched\ndown to the cattle. Beams crossed the opening down into the main floor\nwhere the hay-carts drove in when the hay was hauled in to be pitched\nup. I heard the rain on the roof and smelled the hay and, when I went\ndown, the clean smell of dried dung in the stable. We could pry a board\nloose and see out of the south window down into the courtyard. The other\nwindow looked out on the field toward the north. We could get out of\neither window onto the roof and down, or go down the hay chute if the\nstairs were impractical. It was a big barn and we could hide in the hay\nif we heard any one. It seemed like a good place. I was sure we could\nhave gotten through to the south if they had not fired on us. It was\nimpossible that there were Germans there. They were coming from the\nnorth and down the road from Cividale. They could not have come through\nfrom the south. The Italians were even more dangerous. They were\nfrightened and firing on anything they saw. Last night on the retreat we\nhad heard that there had been many Germans in Italian uniforms mixing\nwith the retreat in the north. I did not believe it. That was one of\nthose things you always heard in the war. It was one of the things the\nenemy always did to you. You did not know any one who went over in\nGerman uniform to confuse them. Maybe they did but it sounded difficult.\nI did not believe the Germans did it. I did not believe they had to.\nThere was no need to confuse our retreat. The size of the army and the\nfewness of the roads did that. Nobody gave any orders, let alone\nGermans. Still, they would shoot us for Germans. They shot Aymo. The hay\nsmelled good and lying in a barn in the hay took away all the years in\nbetween. We had lain in hay and talked and shot sparrows with an\nair-rifle when they perched in the triangle cut high up in the wall of\nthe barn. The barn was gone now and one year they had cut the hemlock\nwoods and there were only stumps, dried tree-tops, branches and fireweed\nwhere the woods had been. You could not go back. If you did not go\nforward what happened? You never got back to Milan. And if you got back\nto Milan what happened? I listened to the firing to the north toward\nUdine. I could hear machine-gun firing. There was no shelling. That was\nsomething. They must have gotten some troops along the road. I looked\ndown in the half-light of the hay-barn and saw Piani standing on the\nhauling floor. He had a long sausage, a jar of something and two bottles\nof wine under his arm.\n\n“Come up,” I said. “There is the ladder.” Then I realized that I should\nhelp him with the things and went down. I was vague in the head from\nlying in the hay. I had been nearly asleep.\n\n“Where’s Bonello?” I asked.\n\n“I’ll tell you,” Piani said. We went up the ladder. Up on the hay we set\nthe things down. Piani took out his knife with the corkscrew and drew\nthe cork on a wine bottle.\n\n“They have sealing-wax on it,” he said. “It must be good.” He smiled.\n\n“Where’s Bonello?” I asked.\n\nPiani looked at me.\n\n“He went away, Tenente,” he said. “He wanted to be a prisoner.”\n\nI did not say anything.\n\n“He was afraid we would get killed.”\n\nI held the bottle of wine and did not say anything.\n\n“You see we don’t believe in the war anyway, Tenente.”\n\n“Why didn’t you go?” I asked.\n\n“I did not want to leave you.”\n\n“Where did he go?”\n\n“I don’t know, Tenente. He went away.”\n\n“All right,” I said. “Will you cut the sausage?”\n\nPiani looked at me in the half-light.\n\n“I cut it while we were talking,” he said. We sat in the hay and ate the\nsausage and drank the wine. It must have been wine they had saved for a\nwedding. It was so old that it was losing its color.\n\n“You look out of this window, Luigi,” I said. “I’ll go look out the\nother window.”"}
{"text": "We had each been drinking out of one of the bottles and I took my bottle\nwith me and went over and lay flat on the hay and looked out the narrow\nwindow at the wet country. I do not know what I expected to see but I\ndid not see anything except the fields and the bare mulberry trees and\nthe rain falling. I drank the wine and it did not make me feel good.\nThey had kept it too long and it had gone to pieces and lost its quality\nand color. I watched it get dark outside; the darkness came very\nquickly. It would be a black night with the rain. When it was dark there\nwas no use watching any more, so I went over to Piani. He was lying\nasleep and I did not wake him but sat down beside him for a while. He\nwas a big man and he slept heavily. After a while I woke him and we\nstarted.\n\nThat was a very strange night. I do not know what I had expected, death\nperhaps and shooting in the dark and running, but nothing happened. We\nwaited, lying flat beyond the ditch along the main road while a German\nbattalion passed, then when they were gone we crossed the road and went\non to the north. We were very close to Germans twice in the rain but\nthey did not see us. We got past the town to the north without seeing\nany Italians, then after a while came on the main channels of the\nretreat and walked all night toward the Tagliamento. I had not realized\nhow gigantic the retreat was. The whole country was moving, as well as\nthe army. We walked all night, making better time than the vehicles. My\nleg ached and I was tired but we made good time. It seemed so silly for\nBonello to have decided to be taken prisoner. There was no danger. We\nhad walked through two armies without incident. If Aymo had not been\nkilled there would never have seemed to be any danger. No one had\nbothered us when we were in plain sight along the railway. The killing\ncame suddenly and unreasonably. I wondered where Bonello was.\n\n“How do you feel, Tenente?” Piani asked. We were going along the side of\na road crowded with vehicles and troops.\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“I’m tired of this walking.”\n\n“Well, all we have to do is walk now. We don’t have to worry.”\n\n“Bonello was a fool.”\n\n“He was a fool all right.”\n\n“What will you do about him, Tenente?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Can’t you just put him down as taken prisoner?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“You see if the war went on they would make bad trouble for his family.”\n\n“The war won’t go on,” a soldier said. “We’re going home. The war is\nover.”\n\n“Everybody’s going home.”\n\n“We’re all going home.”\n\n“Come on, Tenente,” Piani said. He wanted to get past them.\n\n“Tenente? Who’s a Tenente? _A basso gli ufficiali!_ Down with the\nofficers!”\n\nPiani took me by the arm. “I better call you by your name,” he said.\n“They might try and make trouble. They’ve shot some officers.” We worked\nup past them.\n\n“I won’t make a report that will make trouble for his family.” I went on\nwith our conversation.\n\n“If the war is over it makes no difference,” Piani said. “But I don’t\nbelieve it’s over. It’s too good that it should be over.”\n\n“We’ll know pretty soon,” I said.\n\n“I don’t believe it’s over. They all think it’s over but I don’t believe\nit.”\n\n“_Viva la Pace!_” a soldier shouted out. “We’re going home!”\n\n“It would be fine if we all went home,” Piani said. “Wouldn’t you like\nto go home?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“We’ll never go. I don’t think it’s over.”\n\n“_Andiamo a casa!_” a soldier shouted.\n\n“They throw away their rifles,” Piani said. “They take them off and drop\nthem down while they’re marching. Then they shout.”\n\n“They ought to keep their rifles.”\n\n“They think if they throw away their rifles they can’t make them fight.”\n\nIn the dark and the rain, making our way along the side of the road I\ncould see that many of the troops still had their rifles. They stuck up\nabove the capes.\n\n“What brigade are you?” an officer called out.\n\n“_Brigata di Pace_,” some one shouted. “Peace Brigade!” The officer said\nnothing.\n\n“What does he say? What does the officer say?”\n\n“Down with the officer. _Viva la Pace!_”\n\n“Come on,” Piani said. We passed two British ambulances, abandoned in\nthe block of vehicles.\n\n“They’re from Gorizia,” Piani said. “I know the cars.”\n\n“They got further than we did.”\n\n“They started earlier.”\n\n“I wonder where the drivers are?”"}
{"text": "“Up ahead probably.”\n\n“The Germans have stopped outside Udine,” I said. “These people will all\nget across the river.”\n\n“Yes,” Piani said. “That’s why I think the war will go on.”\n\n“The Germans could come on,” I said. “I wonder why they don’t come on.”\n\n“I don’t know. I don’t know anything about this kind of war.”\n\n“They have to wait for their transport I suppose.”\n\n“I don’t know,” Piani said. Alone he was much gentler. When he was with\nthe others he was a very rough talker.\n\n“Are you married, Luigi?”\n\n“You know I am married.”\n\n“Is that why you did not want to be a prisoner?”\n\n“That is one reason. Are you married, Tenente?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Neither is Bonello.”\n\n“You can’t tell anything by a man’s being married. But I should think a\nmarried man would want to get back to his wife,” I said. I would be glad\nto talk about wives.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“How are your feet?”\n\n“They’re sore enough.”\n\nBefore daylight we reached the bank of the Tagliamento and followed down\nalong the flooded river to the bridge where all the traffic was\ncrossing.\n\n“They ought to be able to hold at this river,” Piani said. In the dark\nthe flood looked high. The water swirled and it was wide. The wooden\nbridge was nearly three-quarters of a mile across, and the river, that\nusually ran in narrow channels in the wide stony bed far below the\nbridge, was close under the wooden planking. We went along the bank and\nthen worked our way into the crowd that were crossing the bridge.\nCrossing slowly in the rain a few feet above the flood, pressed tight in\nthe crowd, the box of an artillery caisson just ahead, I looked over the\nside and watched the river. Now that we could not go our own pace I felt\nvery tired. There was no exhilaration in crossing the bridge. I wondered\nwhat it would be like if a plane bombed it in the daytime.\n\n“Piani,” I said.\n\n“Here I am, Tenente.” He was a little ahead in the jam. No one was\ntalking. They were all trying to get across as soon as they could:\nthinking only of that. We were almost across. At the far end of the\nbridge there were officers and carabinieri standing on both sides\nflashing lights. I saw them silhouetted against the sky-line. As we came\nclose to them I saw one of the officers point to a man in the column. A\ncarabiniere went in after him and came out holding the man by the arm.\nHe took him away from the road. We came almost opposite them. The\nofficers were scrutinizing every one in the column, sometimes speaking\nto each other, going forward to flash a light in some one’s face. They\ntook some one else out just before we came opposite. I saw the man. He\nwas a lieutenant-colonel. I saw the stars in the box on his sleeve as\nthey flashed a light on him. His hair was gray and he was short and fat.\nThe carabiniere pulled him in behind the line of officers. As we came\nopposite I saw one or two of them look at me. Then one pointed at me and\nspoke to a carabiniere. I saw the carabiniere start for me, come through\nthe edge of the column toward me, then felt him take me by the collar.\n\n“What’s the matter with you?” I said and hit him in the face. I saw his\nface under the hat, upturned mustaches and blood coming down his cheek.\nAnother one dove in toward us.\n\n“What’s the matter with you?” I said. He did not answer. He was watching\na chance to grab me. I put my arm behind me to loosen my pistol.\n\n“Don’t you know you can’t touch an officer?”\n\nThe other one grabbed me from behind and pulled my arm up so that it\ntwisted in the socket. I turned with him and the other one grabbed me\naround the neck. I kicked his shins and got my left knee into his groin.\n\n“Shoot him if he resists,” I heard some one say.\n\n“What’s the meaning of this?” I tried to shout but my voice was not very\nloud. They had me at the side of the road now.\n\n“Shoot him if he resists,” an officer said. “Take him over back.”\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n“You’ll find out.”\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n“Battle police,” another officer said.\n\n“Why don’t you ask me to step over instead of having one of these\nairplanes grab me?”\n\nThey did not answer. They did not have to answer. They were battle\npolice.\n\n“Take him back there with the others,” the first officer said. “You see.\nHe speaks Italian with an accent.”\n\n“So do you, you ——,” I said."}
{"text": "“Take him back with the others,” the first officer said. They took me\ndown behind the line of officers below the road toward a group of people\nin a field by the river bank. As we walked toward them shots were fired.\nI saw flashes of the rifles and heard the reports. We came up to the\ngroup. There were four officers standing together, with a man in front\nof them with a carabiniere on each side of him. A group of men were\nstanding guarded by carabinieri. Four other carabinieri stood near the\nquestioning officers, leaning on their carbines. They were wide-hatted\ncarabinieri. The two who had me shoved me in with the group waiting to\nbe questioned. I looked at the man the officers were questioning. He was\nthe fat gray-haired little lieutenant-colonel they had taken out of the\ncolumn. The questioners had all the efficiency, coldness and command of\nthemselves of Italians who are firing and are not being fired on.\n\n“Your brigade?”\n\nHe told them.\n\n“Regiment?”\n\nHe told them.\n\n“Why are you not with your regiment?”\n\nHe told them.\n\n“Do you not know that an officer should be with his troops?”\n\nHe did.\n\nThat was all. Another officer spoke.\n\n“It is you and such as you that have let the barbarians onto the sacred\nsoil of the fatherland.”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said the lieutenant-colonel.\n\n“It is because of treachery such as yours that we have lost the fruits\nof victory.”\n\n“Have you ever been in a retreat?” the lieutenant-colonel asked.\n\n“Italy should never retreat.”\n\nWe stood there in the rain and listened to this. We were facing the\nofficers and the prisoner stood in front and a little to one side of us.\n\n“If you are going to shoot me,” the lieutenant-colonel said, “please\nshoot me at once without further questioning. The questioning is\nstupid.” He made the sign of the cross. The officers spoke together. One\nwrote something on a pad of paper.\n\n“Abandoned his troops, ordered to be shot,” he said.\n\nTwo carabinieri took the lieutenant-colonel to the river bank. He walked\nin the rain, an old man with his hat off, a carabiniere on either side.\nI did not watch them shoot him but I heard the shots. They were\nquestioning some one else. This officer too was separated from his\ntroops. He was not allowed to make an explanation. He cried when they\nread the sentence from the pad of paper, and they were questioning\nanother when they shot him. They made a point of being intent on\nquestioning the next man while the man who had been questioned before\nwas being shot. In this way there was obviously nothing they could do\nabout it. I did not know whether I should wait to be questioned or make\na break now. I was obviously a German in Italian uniform. I saw how\ntheir minds worked; if they had minds and if they worked. They were all\nyoung men and they were saving their country. The second army was being\nre-formed beyond the Tagliamento. They were executing officers of the\nrank of major and above who were separated from their troops. They were\nalso dealing summarily with German agitators in Italian uniform. They\nwore steel helmets. Only two of us had steel helmets. Some of the\ncarabinieri had them. The other carabinieri wore the wide hat. Airplanes\nwe called them. We stood in the rain and were taken out one at a time to\nbe questioned and shot. So far they had shot every one they had\nquestioned. The questioners had that beautiful detachment and devotion\nto stern justice of men dealing in death without being in any danger of\nit. They were questioning a full colonel of a line regiment. Three more\nofficers had just been put in with us.\n\n“Where was his regiment?”"}
{"text": "I looked at the carabinieri. They were looking at the newcomers. The\nothers were looking at the colonel. I ducked down, pushed between two\nmen, and ran for the river, my head down. I tripped at the edge and went\nin with a splash. The water was very cold and I stayed under as long as\nI could. I could feel the current swirl me and I stayed under until I\nthought I could never come up. The minute I came up I took a breath and\nwent down again. It was easy to stay under with so much clothing and my\nboots. When I came up the second time I saw a piece of timber ahead of\nme and reached it and held on with one hand. I kept my head behind it\nand did not even look over it. I did not want to see the bank. There\nwere shots when I ran and shots when I came up the first time. I heard\nthem when I was almost above water. There were no shots now. The piece\nof timber swung in the current and I held it with one hand. I looked at\nthe bank. It seemed to be going by very fast. There was much wood in the\nstream. The water was very cold. We passed the brush of an island above\nthe water. I held onto the timber with both hands and let it take me\nalong. The shore was out of sight now.\n\nYou do not know how long you are in a river when the current moves\nswiftly. It seems a long time and it may be very short. The water was\ncold and in flood and many things passed that had been floated off the\nbanks when the river rose. I was lucky to have a heavy timber to hold on\nto, and I lay in the icy water with my chin on the wood, holding as\neasily as I could with both hands. I was afraid of cramps and I hoped we\nwould move toward the shore. We went down the river in a long curve. It\nwas beginning to be light enough so I could see the bushes along the\nshore-line. There was a brush island ahead and the current moved toward\nthe shore. I wondered if I should take off my boots and clothes and try\nto swim ashore, but decided not to. I had never thought of anything but\nthat I would reach the shore some way, and I would be in a bad position\nif I landed barefoot. I had to get to Mestre some way.\n\nI watched the shore come close, then swing away, then come closer again.\nWe were floating more slowly. The shore was very close now. I could see\ntwigs on the willow bush. The timber swung slowly so that the bank was\nbehind me and I knew we were in an eddy. We went slowly around. As I saw\nthe bank again, very close now, I tried holding with one arm and kicking\nand swimming the timber toward the bank with the other, but I did not\nbring it any closer. I was afraid we would move out of the eddy and,\nholding with one hand, I drew up my feet so they were against the side\nof the timber and shoved hard toward the bank. I could see the brush,\nbut even with my momentum and swimming as hard as I could, the current\nwas taking me away. I thought then I would drown because of my boots,\nbut I thrashed and fought through the water, and when I looked up the\nbank was coming toward me, and I kept thrashing and swimming in a\nheavy-footed panic until I reached it. I hung to the willow branch and\ndid not have strength to pull myself up but I knew I would not drown\nnow. It had never occurred to me on the timber that I might drown. I\nfelt hollow and sick in my stomach and chest from the effort, and I held\nto the branches and waited. When the sick feeling was gone I pulled into\nthe willow bushes and rested again, my arms around some brush, holding\ntight with my hands to the branches. Then I crawled out, pushed on\nthrough the willows and onto the bank. It was half-daylight and I saw no\none. I lay flat on the bank and heard the river and the rain."}
{"text": "After a while I got up and started along the bank. I knew there was no\nbridge across the river until Latisana. I thought I might be opposite\nSan Vito. I began to think out what I should do. Ahead there was a ditch\nrunning into the river. I went toward it. So far I had seen no one and I\nsat down by some bushes along the bank of the ditch and took off my\nshoes and emptied them of water. I took off my coat, took my wallet with\nmy papers and my money all wet in it out of the inside pocket and then\nwrung the coat out. I took off my trousers and wrung them too, then my\nshirt and underclothing. I slapped and rubbed myself and then dressed\nagain. I had lost my cap.\n\nBefore I put on my coat I cut the cloth stars off my sleeves and put\nthem in the inside pocket with my money. My money was wet but was all\nright. I counted it. There were three thousand and some lire. My clothes\nfelt wet and clammy and I slapped my arms to keep the circulation going.\nI had woven underwear and I did not think I would catch cold if I kept\nmoving. They had taken my pistol at the road and I put the holster under\nmy coat. I had no cape and it was cold in the rain. I started up the\nbank of the canal. It was daylight and the country was wet, low and\ndismal looking. The fields were bare and wet; a long way away I could\nsee a campanile rising out of the plain. I came up onto a road. Ahead I\nsaw some troops coming down the road. I limped along the side of the\nroad and they passed me and paid no attention to me. They were a\nmachine-gun detachment going up toward the river. I went on down the\nroad."}
{"text": "That day I crossed the Venetian plain. It is a low level country and\nunder the rain it is even flatter. Toward the sea there are salt marshes\nand very few roads. The roads all go along the river mouths to the sea\nand to cross the country you must go along the paths beside the canals.\nI was working across the country from the north to the south and had\ncrossed two railway lines and many roads and finally I came out at the\nend of a path onto a railway line where it ran beside a marsh. It was\nthe main line from Venice to Trieste, with a high solid embankment, a\nsolid roadbed and double track. Down the tracks a way was a flag-station\nand I could see soldiers on guard. Up the line there was a bridge over a\nstream that flowed into the marsh. I could see a guard too at the\nbridge. Crossing the fields to the north I had seen a train pass on this\nrailroad, visible a long way across the flat plain, and I thought a\ntrain might come from Portogruaro. I watched the guards and lay down on\nthe embankment so that I could see both ways along the track. The guard\nat the bridge walked a way up the line toward where I lay, then turned\nand went back toward the bridge. I lay, and was hungry, and waited for\nthe train. The one I had seen was so long that the engine moved it very\nslowly and I was sure I could get aboard it. After I had almost given up\nhoping for one I saw a train coming. The engine, coming straight on,\ngrew larger slowly. I looked at the guard at the bridge. He was walking\non the near side of the bridge but on the other side of the tracks. That\nwould put him out of sight when the train passed. I watched the engine\ncome nearer. It was working hard. I could see there were many cars. I\nknew there would be guards on the train, and I tried to see where they\nwere, but, keeping out of sight, I could not. The engine was almost to\nwhere I was lying. When it came opposite, working and puffing even on\nthe level, and I saw the engineer pass, I stood up and stepped up close\nto the passing cars. If the guards were watching I was a less suspicious\nobject standing beside the track. Several closed freight-cars passed.\nThen I saw a low open car of the sort they call gondolas coming, covered\nwith canvas. I stood until it had almost passed, then jumped and caught\nthe rear hand-rods and pulled up. I crawled down between the gondola and\nthe shelter of the high freight-car behind. I did not think any one had\nseen me. I was holding to the hand-rods and crouching low, my feet on\nthe coupling. We were almost opposite the bridge. I remembered the\nguard. As we passed him he looked at me. He was a boy and his helmet was\ntoo big for him. I stared at him contemptuously and he looked away. He\nthought I had something to do with the train.\n\nWe were past. I saw him still looking uncomfortable, watching the other\ncars pass and I stooped to see how the canvas was fastened. It had\ngrummets and was laced down at the edge with cord. I took out my knife,\ncut the cord and put my arm under. There were hard bulges under the\ncanvas that tightened in the rain. I looked up and ahead. There was a\nguard on the freight-car ahead but he was looking forward. I let go of\nthe hand-rails and ducked under the canvas. My forehead hit something\nthat gave me a violent bump and I felt blood on my face but I crawled on\nin and lay flat. Then I turned around and fastened down the canvas."}
{"text": "I was in under the canvas with guns. They smelled cleanly of oil and\ngrease. I lay and listened to the rain on the canvas and the clicking of\nthe car over the rails. There was a little light came through and I lay\nand looked at the guns. They had their canvas jackets on. I thought they\nmust have been sent ahead from the third army. The bump on my forehead\nwas swollen and I stopped the bleeding by lying still and letting it\ncoagulate, then picked away the dried blood except over the cut. It was\nnothing. I had no handkerchief, but feeling with my fingers I washed\naway where the dried blood had been, with rain-water that dripped from\nthe canvas, and wiped it clean with the sleeve of my coat. I did not\nwant to look conspicuous. I knew I would have to get out before they got\nto Mestre because they would be taking care of these guns. They had no\nguns to lose or forget about. I was terrifically hungry.\n\nLying on the floor of the flat-car with the guns beside me under the\ncanvas I was wet, cold and very hungry. Finally I rolled over and lay\nflat on my stomach with my head on my arms. My knee was stiff, but it\nhad been very satisfactory. Valentini had done a fine job. I had done\nhalf the retreat on foot and swum part of the Tagliamento with his knee.\nIt was his knee all right. The other knee was mine. Doctors did things\nto you and then it was not your body any more. The head was mine, and\nthe inside of the belly. It was very hungry in there. I could feel it\nturn over on itself. The head was mine, but not to use, not to think\nwith; only to remember and not too much remember.\n\nI could remember Catherine but I knew I would get crazy if I thought\nabout her when I was not sure yet I would see her, so I would not think\nabout her, only about her a little, only about her with the car going\nslowly and clickingly, and some light through the canvas and my lying\nwith Catherine on the floor of the car. Hard as the floor of the car to\nlie not thinking only feeling, having been away too long, the clothes\nwet and the floor moving only a little each time and lonesome inside and\nalone with wet clothing and hard floor for a wife.\n\nYou did not love the floor of a flat-car nor guns with canvas jackets\nand the smell of vaselined metal or a canvas that rain leaked through,\nalthough it is very fine under a canvas and pleasant with guns; but you\nloved some one else whom now you knew was not even to be pretended\nthere; you seeing now very clearly and coldly—not so coldly as clearly\nand emptily. You saw emptily, lying on your stomach, having been present\nwhen one army moved back and another came forward. You had lost your\ncars and your men as a floorwalker loses the stock of his department in\na fire. There was, however, no insurance. You were out of it now. You\nhad no more obligation. If they shot floorwalkers after a fire in the\ndepartment store because they spoke with an accent they had always had,\nthen certainly the floorwalkers would not be expected to return when the\nstore opened again for business. They might seek other employment; if\nthere was any other employment and the police did not get them.\n\nAnger was washed away in the river along with any obligation. Although\nthat ceased when the carabiniere put his hands on my collar. I would\nlike to have had the uniform off although I did not care much about the\noutward forms. I had taken off the stars, but that was for convenience.\nIt was no point of honor. I was not against them. I was through. I\nwished them all the luck. There were the good ones, and the brave ones,\nand the calm ones and the sensible ones, and they deserved it. But it\nwas not my show any more and I wished this bloody train would get to\nMestre and I would eat and stop thinking. I would have to stop."}
{"text": "Piani would tell them they had shot me. They went through the pockets\nand took the papers of the people they shot. They would not have my\npapers. They might call me drowned. I wondered what they would hear in\nthe States. Dead from wounds and other causes. Good Christ I was hungry.\nI wondered what had become of the priest at the mess. And Rinaldi. He\nwas probably at Pordenone. If they had not gone further back. Well, I\nwould never see him now. I would never see any of them now. That life\nwas over. I did not think he had syphilis. It was not a serious disease\nanyway if you took it in time, they said. But he would worry. I would\nworry too if I had it. Any one would worry.\n\nI was not made to think. I was made to eat. My God, yes. Eat and drink\nand sleep with Catherine. To-night maybe. No that was impossible. But\nto-morrow night, and a good meal and sheets and never going away again\nexcept together. Probably have to go damned quickly. She would go. I\nknew she would go. When would we go? That was something to think about.\nIt was getting dark. I lay and thought where we would go. There were\nmany places.\n\nI dropped off the train in Milan as it slowed to come into the station\nearly in the morning before it was light. I crossed the track and came\nout between some buildings and down onto the street. A wine shop was\nopen and I went in for some coffee. It smelled of early morning, of\nswept dust, spoons in coffee-glasses and the wet circles left by\nwine-glasses. The proprietor was behind the bar. Two soldiers sat at a\ntable. I stood at the bar and drank a glass of coffee and ate a piece of\nbread. The coffee was gray with milk, and I skimmed the milk scum off\nthe top with a piece of bread. The proprietor looked at me.\n\n“You want a glass of grappa?”\n\n“No thanks.”\n\n“On me,” he said and poured a small glass and pushed it toward me.\n“What’s happening at the front?”\n\n“I would not know.”\n\n“They are drunk,” he said, moving his hand toward the two soldiers. I\ncould believe him. They looked drunk.\n\n“Tell me,” he said, “what is happening at the front?”\n\n“I would not know about the front.”\n\n“I saw you come down the wall. You came off the train.”\n\n“There is a big retreat.”\n\n“I read the papers. What happens? Is it over?”\n\n“I don’t think so.”\n\nHe filled the glass with grappa from a short bottle. “If you are in\ntrouble,” he said, “I can keep you.”\n\n“I am not in trouble.”\n\n“If you are in trouble stay here with me.”\n\n“Where does one stay?”\n\n“In the building. Many stay here. Any who are in trouble stay here.”\n\n“Are many in trouble?”\n\n“It depends on the trouble. You are a South American?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Speak Spanish?”\n\n“A little.”\n\nHe wiped off the bar.\n\n“It is hard now to leave the country but in no way impossible.”\n\n“I have no wish to leave.”\n\n“You can stay here as long as you want. You will see what sort of man I\nam.”\n\n“I have to go this morning but I will remember the address to return.”\n\nHe shook his head. “You won’t come back if you talk like that. I thought\nyou were in real trouble.”\n\n“I am in no trouble. But I value the address of a friend.”\n\nI put a ten-lira note on the bar to pay for the coffee.\n\n“Have a grappa with me,” I said.\n\n“It is not necessary.”\n\n“Have one.”\n\nHe poured the two glasses.\n\n“Remember,” he said. “Come here. Do not let other people take you in.\nHere you are all right.”\n\n“I am sure.”\n\n“You are sure?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe was serious. “Then let me tell you one thing. Do not go about with\nthat coat.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“On the sleeves it shows very plainly where the stars have been cut\naway. The cloth is a different color.”\n\nI did not say anything.\n\n“If you have no papers I can give you papers.”\n\n“What papers?”\n\n“Leave-papers.”\n\n“I have no need for papers. I have papers.”\n\n“All right,” he said. “But if you need papers I can get what you wish.”\n\n“How much are such papers?”\n\n“It depends on what they are. The price is reasonable.”\n\n“I don’t need any now.”\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“I’m all right,” I said.\n\nWhen I went out he said, “Don’t forget that I am your friend.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I will see you again,” he said.\n\n“Good,” I said."}
{"text": "Outside I kept away from the station, where there were military police,\nand picked up a cab at the edge of the little park. I gave the driver\nthe address of the hospital. At the hospital I went to the porter’s\nlodge. His wife embraced me. He shook my hand.\n\n“You are back. You are safe.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Have you had breakfast?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“How are you, Tenente? How are you?” the wife asked.\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“Won’t you have breakfast with us?”\n\n“No, thank you. Tell me is Miss Barkley here at the hospital now?”\n\n“Miss Barkley?”\n\n“The English lady nurse.”\n\n“His girl,” the wife said. She patted my arm and smiled.\n\n“No,” the porter said. “She is away.”\n\nMy heart went down. “You are sure? I mean the tall blonde English young\nlady.”\n\n“I am sure. She is gone to Stresa.”\n\n“When did she go?”\n\n“She went two days ago with the other lady English.”\n\n“Good,” I said. “I wish you to do something for me. Do not tell any one\nyou have seen me. It is very important.”\n\n“I won’t tell any one,” the porter said. I gave him a ten-lira note. He\npushed it away.\n\n“I promise you I will tell no one,” he said. “I don’t want any money.”\n\n“What can we do for you, Signor Tenente?” his wife asked.\n\n“Only that,” I said.\n\n“We are dumb,” the porter said. “You will let me know anything I can\ndo?”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “Good-by. I will see you again.”\n\nThey stood in the door, looking after me.\n\nI got into the cab and gave the driver the address of Simmons, one of\nthe men I knew who was studying singing.\n\nSimmons lived a long way out in the town toward the Porta Magenta. He\nwas still in bed and sleepy when I went to see him.\n\n“You get up awfully early, Henry,” he said.\n\n“I came in on the early train.”\n\n“What’s all this retreat? Were you at the front? Will you have a\ncigarette? They’re in that box on the table.” It was a big room with a\nbed beside the wall, a piano over on the far side and a dresser and\ntable. I sat on a chair by the bed. Simmons sat propped up by the\npillows and smoked.\n\n“I’m in a jam, Sim,” I said.\n\n“So am I,” he said. “I’m always in a jam. Won’t you smoke?”\n\n“No,” I said. “What’s the procedure in going to Switzerland?”\n\n“For you? The Italians wouldn’t let you out of the country.”\n\n“Yes. I know that. But the Swiss. What will they do?”\n\n“They intern you.”\n\n“I know. But what’s the mechanics of it?”\n\n“Nothing. It’s very simple. You can go anywhere. I think you just have\nto report or something. Why? Are you fleeing the police?”\n\n“Nothing definite yet.”\n\n“Don’t tell me if you don’t want. But it would be interesting to hear.\nNothing happens here. I was a great flop at Piacenza.”\n\n“I’m awfully sorry.”\n\n“Oh yes—I went very badly. I sung well too. I’m going to try it again\nat the Lyrico here.”\n\n“I’d like to be there.”\n\n“You’re awfully polite. You aren’t in a bad mess, are you?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Don’t tell me if you don’t want. How do you happen to be away from the\nbloody front?”\n\n“I think I’m through with it.”\n\n“Good boy. I always knew you had sense. Can I help you any way?”\n\n“You’re awfully busy.”\n\n“Not a bit of it, my dear Henry. Not a bit of it. I’d be happy to do\nanything.”\n\n“You’re about my size. Would you go out and buy me an outfit of civilian\nclothes? I’ve clothes but they’re all at Rome.”\n\n“You did live there, didn’t you? It’s a filthy place. How did you ever\nlive there?”\n\n“I wanted to be an architect.”\n\n“That’s no place for that. Don’t buy clothes. I’ll give you all the\nclothes you want. I’ll fit you out so you’ll be a great success. Go in\nthat dressing room. There’s a closet. Take anything you want. My dear\nfellow, you don’t want to buy clothes.”\n\n“I’d rather buy them, Sim.”\n\n“My dear fellow, it’s easier for me to let you have them than go out and\nbuy them. Have you got a passport? You won’t get far without a\npassport.”\n\n“Yes. I’ve still got my passport.”\n\n“Then get dressed, my dear fellow, and off to old Helvetia.”\n\n“It’s not that simple. I have to go up to Stresa first.”\n\n“Ideal, my dear fellow. You just row a boat across. If I wasn’t trying\nto sing, I’d go with you. I’ll go yet.”\n\n“You could take up yodelling.”\n\n“My dear fellow, I’ll take up yodelling yet. I really can sing though.\nThat’s the strange part.”\n\n“I’ll bet you can sing.”\n\nHe lay back in bed smoking a cigarette."}
{"text": "“Don’t bet too much. But I can sing though. It’s damned funny, but I\ncan. I like to sing. Listen.” He roared into “Africana,” his neck\nswelling, the veins standing out. “I can sing,” he said. “Whether they\nlike it or not.” I looked out of the window. “I’ll go down and let my\ncab go.”\n\n“Come back up, my dear fellow, and we’ll have breakfast.” He stepped out\nof bed, stood straight, took a deep breath and commenced doing bending\nexercises. I went downstairs and paid off the cab.\n\nIn civilian clothes I felt a masquerader. I had been in uniform a long\ntime and I missed the feeling of being held by your clothes. The\ntrousers felt very floppy. I had bought a ticket at Milan for Stresa. I\nhad also bought a new hat. I could not wear Sim’s hat but his clothes\nwere fine. They smelled of tobacco and as I sat in the compartment and\nlooked out the window the new hat felt very new and the clothes very\nold. I myself felt as sad as the wet Lombard country that was outside\nthrough the window. There were some aviators in the compartment who did\nnot think much of me. They avoided looking at me and were very scornful\nof a civilian my age. I did not feel insulted. In the old days I would\nhave insulted them and picked a fight. They got off at Gallarate and I\nwas glad to be alone. I had the paper but I did not read it because I\ndid not want to read about the war. I was going to forget the war. I had\nmade a separate peace. I felt damned lonely and was glad when the train\ngot to Stresa.\n\nAt the station I had expected to see the porters from the hotels but\nthere was no one. The season had been over a long time and no one met\nthe train. I got down from the train with my bag, it was Sim’s bag, and\nvery light to carry, being empty except for two shirts, and stood under\nthe roof of the station in the rain while the train went on. I found a\nman in the station and asked him if he knew what hotels were open. The\nGrand-Hôtel & des Isles Borromées was open and several small hotels that\nstayed open all the year. I started in the rain for the Isles Borromées\ncarrying my bag. I saw a carriage coming down the street and signalled\nto the driver. It was better to arrive in a carriage. We drove up to the\ncarriage entrance of the big hotel and the concierge came out with an\numbrella and was very polite.\n\nI took a good room. It was very big and light and looked out on the\nlake. The clouds were down over the lake but it would be beautiful with\nthe sunlight. I was expecting my wife, I said. There was a big double\nbed, a _letto matrimoniale_ with a satin coverlet. The hotel was very\nluxurious. I went down the long halls, down the wide stairs, through the\nrooms to the bar. I knew the barman and sat on a high stool and ate\nsalted almonds and potato chips. The martini felt cool and clean.\n\n“What are you doing here in _borghese_?” the barman asked after he had\nmixed a second martini.\n\n“I am on leave. Convalescing-leave.”\n\n“There is no one here. I don’t know why they keep the hotel open.”\n\n“Have you been fishing?”\n\n“I’ve caught some beautiful pieces. Trolling this time of year you catch\nsome beautiful pieces.”\n\n“Did you ever get the tobacco I sent?”\n\n“Yes. Didn’t you get my card?”\n\nI laughed. I had not been able to get the tobacco. It was American\npipe-tobacco that he wanted, but my relatives had stopped sending it or\nit was being held up. Anyway it never came.\n\n“I’ll get some somewhere,” I said. “Tell me have you seen two English\ngirls in the town? They came here day before yesterday.”\n\n“They are not at the hotel.”\n\n“They are nurses.”\n\n“I have seen two nurses. Wait a minute, I will find out where they are.”\n\n“One of them is my wife,” I said. “I have come here to meet her.”\n\n“The other is my wife.”\n\n“I am not joking.”\n\n“Pardon my stupid joke,” he said. “I did not understand.” He went away\nand was gone quite a little while. I ate olives, salted almonds and\npotato chips and looked at myself in civilian clothes in the mirror\nbehind the bar. The bartender came back. “They are at the little hotel\nnear the station,” he said.\n\n“How about some sandwiches?”\n\n“I’ll ring for some. You understand there is nothing here, now there are\nno people.”"}
{"text": "“Isn’t there really any one at all?”\n\n“Yes. There are a few people.”\n\nThe sandwiches came and I ate three and drank a couple more martinis. I\nhad never tasted anything so cool and clean. They made me feel\ncivilized. I had had too much red wine, bread, cheese, bad coffee and\ngrappa. I sat on the high stool before the pleasant mahogany, the brass\nand the mirrors and did not think at all. The barman asked me some\nquestion.\n\n“Don’t talk about the war,” I said. The war was a long way away. Maybe\nthere wasn’t any war. There was no war here. Then I realized it was over\nfor me. But I did not have the feeling that it was really over. I had\nthe feeling of a boy who thinks of what is happening at a certain hour\nat the schoolhouse from which he has played truant.\n\nCatherine and Helen Ferguson were at supper when I came to their hotel.\nStanding in the hallway I saw them at table. Catherine’s face was away\nfrom me and I saw the line of her hair and her cheek and her lovely neck\nand shoulders. Ferguson was talking. She stopped when I came in.\n\n“My God,” she said.\n\n“Hello,” I said.\n\n“Why it’s you!” Catherine said. Her face lighted up. She looked too\nhappy to believe it. I kissed her. Catherine blushed and I sat down at\nthe table.\n\n“You’re a fine mess,” Ferguson said. “What are you doing here? Have you\neaten?”\n\n“No.” The girl who was serving the meal came in and I told her to bring\na plate for me. Catherine looked at me all the time, her eyes happy.\n\n“What are you doing in mufti?” Ferguson asked.\n\n“I’m in the Cabinet.”\n\n“You’re in some mess.”\n\n“Cheer up, Fergy. Cheer up just a little.”\n\n“I’m not cheered by seeing you. I know the mess you’ve gotten this girl\ninto. You’re no cheerful sight to me.”\n\nCatherine smiled at me and touched me with her foot under the table.\n\n“No one got me in a mess, Fergy. I get in my own messes.”\n\n“I can’t stand him,” Ferguson said. “He’s done nothing but ruin you with\nhis sneaking Italian tricks. Americans are worse than Italians.”\n\n“The Scotch are such a moral people,” Catherine said.\n\n“I don’t mean that. I mean his Italian sneakiness.”\n\n“Am I sneaky, Fergy?”\n\n“You are. You’re worse than sneaky. You’re like a snake. A snake with an\nItalian uniform: with a cape around your neck.”\n\n“I haven’t got an Italian uniform now.”\n\n“That’s just another example of your sneakiness. You had a love affair\nall summer and got this girl with child and now I suppose you’ll sneak\noff.”\n\nI smiled at Catherine and she smiled at me.\n\n“We’ll both sneak off,” she said.\n\n“You’re two of the same thing,” Ferguson said. “I’m ashamed of you,\nCatherine Barkley. You have no shame and no honor and you’re as sneaky\nas he is.”\n\n“Don’t, Fergy,” Catherine said and patted her hand. “Don’t denounce me.\nYou know we like each other.”\n\n“Take your hand away,” Ferguson said. Her face was red. “If you had any\nshame it would be different. But you’re God knows how many months gone\nwith child and you think it’s a joke and are all smiles because your\nseducer’s come back. You’ve no shame and no feelings.” She began to cry.\nCatherine went over and put her arm around her. As she stood comforting\nFerguson, I could see no change in her figure.\n\n“I don’t care,” Ferguson sobbed. “I think it’s dreadful.”\n\n“There, there, Fergy,” Catherine comforted her. “I’ll be ashamed. Don’t\ncry, Fergy. Don’t cry, old Fergy.”\n\n“I’m not crying,” Ferguson sobbed. “I’m not crying. Except for the awful\nthing you’ve gotten into.” She looked at me. “I hate you,” she said.\n“She can’t make me not hate you. You dirty sneaking American Italian.”\nHer eyes and nose were red with crying.\n\nCatherine smiled at me.\n\n“Don’t you smile at him with your arm around me.”\n\n“You’re unreasonable, Fergy.”\n\n“I know it,” Ferguson sobbed. “You mustn’t mind me, either of you. I’m\nso upset. I’m not reasonable. I know it. I want you both to be happy.”\n\n“We’re happy,” Catherine said. “You’re a sweet Fergy.”\n\nFerguson cried again. “I don’t want you happy the way you are. Why don’t\nyou get married? You haven’t got another wife have you?”\n\n“No,” I said. Catherine laughed.\n\n“It’s nothing to laugh about,” Ferguson said. “Plenty of them have other\nwives.”\n\n“We’ll be married, Fergy,” Catherine said, “if it will please you.”"}
{"text": "“Not to please me. You should want to be married.”\n\n“We’ve been very busy.”\n\n“Yes. I know. Busy making babies.” I thought she was going to cry again\nbut she went into bitterness instead. “I suppose you’ll go off with him\nnow to-night?”\n\n“Yes,” said Catherine. “If he wants me.”\n\n“What about me?”\n\n“Are you afraid to stay here alone?”\n\n“Yes, I am.”\n\n“Then I’ll stay with you.”\n\n“No, go on with him. Go with him right away. I’m sick of seeing both of\nyou.”\n\n“We’d better finish dinner.”\n\n“No. Go right away.”\n\n“Fergy, be reasonable.”\n\n“I say get out right away. Go away both of you.”\n\n“Let’s go then,” I said. I was sick of Fergy.\n\n“You do want to go. You see you want to leave me even to eat dinner\nalone. I’ve always wanted to go to the Italian lakes and this is how it\nis. Oh, Oh,” she sobbed, then looked at Catherine and choked.\n\n“We’ll stay till after dinner,” Catherine said. “And I’ll not leave you\nalone if you want me to stay. I won’t leave you alone, Fergy.”\n\n“No. No. I want you to go. I want you to go.” She wiped her eyes. “I’m\nso unreasonable. Please don’t mind me.”\n\nThe girl who served the meal had been upset by all the crying. Now as\nshe brought in the next course she seemed relieved that things were\nbetter.\n\nThat night at the hotel, in our room with the long empty hall outside\nand our shoes outside the door, a thick carpet on the floor of the room,\noutside the windows the rain falling and in the room light and pleasant\nand cheerful, then the light out and it exciting with smooth sheets and\nthe bed comfortable, feeling that we had come home, feeling no longer\nalone, waking in the night to find the other one there, and not gone\naway; all other things were unreal. We slept when we were tired and if\nwe woke the other one woke too so one was not alone. Often a man wishes\nto be alone and a girl wishes to be alone too and if they love each\nother they are jealous of that in each other, but I can truly say we\nnever felt that. We could feel alone when we were together, alone\nagainst the others. It has only happened to me like that once. I have\nbeen alone while I was with many girls and that is the way that you can\nbe most lonely. But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were\ntogether. I know that the night is not the same as the day: that all\nthings are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained\nin the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can be a\ndreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started. But\nwith Catherine there was almost no difference in the night except that\nit was an even better time. If people bring so much courage to this\nworld the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills\nthem. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the\nbroken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very\ngood and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none\nof these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no\nspecial hurry.\n\nI remember waking in the morning. Catherine was asleep and the sunlight\nwas coming in through the window. The rain had stopped and I stepped out\nof bed and across the floor to the window. Down below were the gardens,\nbare now but beautifully regular, the gravel paths, the trees, the stone\nwall by the lake and the lake in the sunlight with the mountains beyond.\nI stood at the window looking out and when I turned away I saw Catherine\nwas awake and watching me.\n\n“How are you, darling?” she said. “Isn’t it a lovely day?”\n\n“How do you feel?”\n\n“I feel very well. We had a lovely night.”\n\n“Do you want breakfast?”\n\nShe wanted breakfast. So did I and we had it in bed, the November\nsunlight coming in the window, and the breakfast tray across my lap.\n\n“Don’t you want the paper? You always wanted the paper in the hospital.”\n\n“No,” I said. “I don’t want the paper now.”\n\n“Was it so bad you don’t want even to read about it?”\n\n“I don’t want to read about it.”\n\n“I wish I had been with you so I would know about it too.”\n\n“I’ll tell you about it if I ever get it straight in my head.”\n\n“But won’t they arrest you if they catch you out of uniform?”\n\n“They’ll probably shoot me.”"}
{"text": "“Then we’ll not stay here. We’ll get out of the country.”\n\n“I’d thought something of that.”\n\n“We’ll get out. Darling, you shouldn’t take silly chances. Tell me how\ndid you come from Mestre to Milan?”\n\n“I came on the train. I was in uniform then.”\n\n“Weren’t you in danger then?”\n\n“Not much. I had an old order of movement. I fixed the dates on it in\nMestre.”\n\n“Darling, you’re liable to be arrested here any time. I won’t have it.\nIt’s silly to do something like that. Where would we be if they took you\noff?”\n\n“Let’s not think about it. I’m tired of thinking about it.”\n\n“What would you do if they came to arrest you?”\n\n“Shoot them.”\n\n“You see how silly you are, I won’t let you go out of the hotel until we\nleave here.”\n\n“Where are we going to go?”\n\n“Please don’t be that way, darling. We’ll go wherever you say. But\nplease find some place to go right away.”\n\n“Switzerland is down the lake, we can go there.”\n\n“That will be lovely.”\n\nIt was clouding over outside and the lake was darkening.\n\n“I wish we did not always have to live like criminals,” I said.\n\n“Darling, don’t be that way. You haven’t lived like a criminal very\nlong. And we never live like criminals. We’re going to have a fine\ntime.”\n\n“I feel like a criminal. I’ve deserted from the army.”\n\n“Darling, _please_ be sensible. It’s not deserting from the army. It’s\nonly the Italian army.”\n\nI laughed. “You’re a fine girl. Let’s get back into bed. I feel fine in\nbed.”\n\nA little while later Catherine said, “You don’t feel like a criminal do\nyou?”\n\n“No,” I said. “Not when I’m with you.”\n\n“You’re such a silly boy,” she said. “But I’ll look after you. Isn’t it\nsplendid, darling, that I don’t have any morning-sickness?”\n\n“It’s grand.”\n\n“You don’t appreciate what a fine wife you have. But I don’t care. I’ll\nget you some place where they can’t arrest you and then we’ll have a\nlovely time.”\n\n“Let’s go there right away.”\n\n“We will, darling. I’ll go any place any time you wish.”\n\n“Let’s not think about anything.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nCatherine went along the lake to the little hotel to see Ferguson and I\nsat in the bar and read the papers. There were comfortable leather\nchairs in the bar and I sat in one of them and read until the barman\ncame in. The army had not stood at the Tagliamento. They were falling\nback to the Piave. I remembered the Piave. The railroad crossed it near\nSan Dona going up to the front. It was deep and slow there and quite\nnarrow. Down below there were mosquito marshes and canals. There were\nsome lovely villas. Once, before the war, going up to Cortina D’Ampezzo\nI had gone along it for several hours in the hills. Up there it looked\nlike a trout stream, flowing swiftly with shallow stretches and pools\nunder the shadow of the rocks. The road turned off from it at Cadore. I\nwondered how the army that was up there would come down. The barman came\nin.\n\n“Count Greffi was asking for you,” he said.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Count Greffi. You remember the old man who was here when you were here\nbefore.”\n\n“Is he here?”\n\n“Yes, he’s here with his niece. I told him you were here. He wants you\nto play billiards.”\n\n“Where is he?”\n\n“He’s taking a walk.”\n\n“How is he?”\n\n“He’s younger than ever. He drank three champagne cocktails last night\nbefore dinner.”\n\n“How’s his billiard game?”\n\n“Good. He beat me. When I told him you were here he was very pleased.\nThere’s nobody here for him to play with.”\n\nCount Greffi was ninety-four years old. He had been a contemporary of\nMetternich and was an old man with white hair and mustache and beautiful\nmanners. He had been in the diplomatic service of both Austria and Italy\nand his birthday parties were the great social event of Milan. He was\nliving to be one hundred years old and played a smoothly fluent game of\nbilliards that contrasted with his own ninety-four-year-old brittleness.\nI had met him when I had been at Stresa once before out of season and\nwhile we played billiards we drank champagne. I thought it was a\nsplendid custom and he gave me fifteen points in a hundred and beat me.\n\n“Why didn’t you tell me he was here?”\n\n“I forgot it.”\n\n“Who else is here?”\n\n“No one you know. There are only six people altogether.”\n\n“What are you doing now?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Come on out fishing.”\n\n“I could come for an hour.”\n\n“Come on. Bring the trolling line.”"}
{"text": "The barman put on a coat and we went out. We went down and got a boat\nand I rowed while the barman sat in the stern and let out the line with\na spinner and a heavy sinker on the end to troll for lake trout. We\nrowed along the shore, the barman holding the line in his hand and\ngiving it occasional jerks forward. Stresa looked very deserted from the\nlake. There were the long rows of bare trees, the big hotels and the\nclosed villas. I rowed across to Isola Bella and went close to the\nwalls, where the water deepened sharply, and you saw the rock wall\nslanting down in the clear water, and then up and along to the\nfisherman’s island. The sun was under a cloud and the water was dark and\nsmooth and very cold. We did not have a strike though we saw some\ncircles on the water from rising fish.\n\nI rowed up opposite the fisherman’s island where there were boats drawn\nup and men were mending nets.\n\n“Should we get a drink?”\n\n“All right.”\n\nI brought the boat up to the stone pier and the barman pulled in the\nline, coiling it on the bottom of the boat and hooking the spinner on\nthe edge of the gunwale. I stepped out and tied the boat. We went into a\nlittle café, sat at a bare wooden table and ordered vermouth.\n\n“Are you tired from rowing?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I’ll row back,” he said.\n\n“I like to row.”\n\n“Maybe if you hold the line it will change the luck.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Tell me how goes the war.”\n\n“Rotten.”\n\n“I don’t have to go. I’m too old, like Count Greffi.”\n\n“Maybe you’ll have to go yet.”\n\n“Next year they’ll call my class. But I won’t go.”\n\n“What will you do?”\n\n“Get out of the country. I wouldn’t go to war. I was at the war once in\nAbyssinia. Nix. Why do you go?”\n\n“I don’t know. I was a fool.”\n\n“Have another vermouth?”\n\n“All right.”\n\nThe barman rowed back. We trolled up the lake beyond Stresa and then\ndown not far from shore. I held the taut line and felt the faint pulsing\nof the spinner revolving while I looked at the dark November water of\nthe lake and the deserted shore. The barman rowed with long strokes and\non the forward thrust of the boat the line throbbed. Once I had a\nstrike: the line hardened suddenly and jerked back, I pulled and felt\nthe live weight of the trout and then the line throbbed again. I had\nmissed him.\n\n“Did he feel big?”\n\n“Pretty big.”\n\n“Once when I was out trolling alone I had the line in my teeth and one\nstruck and nearly took my mouth out.”\n\n“The best way is to have it over your leg,” I said. “Then you feel it\nand don’t lose your teeth.”\n\nI put my hand in the water. It was very cold. We were almost opposite\nthe hotel now.\n\n“I have to go in,” the barman said, “to be there for eleven o’clock.\n_L’heure du cocktail._”\n\n“All right.”\n\nI pulled in the line and wrapped it on a stick notched at each end. The\nbarman put the boat in a little slip in the stone wall and locked it\nwith a chain and padlock.\n\n“Any time you want it,” he said, “I’ll give you the key.”\n\n“Thanks.”\n\nWe went up to the hotel and in to the bar. I did not want another drink\nso early in the morning so I went up to our room. The maid had just\nfinished doing the room and Catherine was not back yet. I lay down on\nthe bed and tried to keep from thinking.\n\nWhen Catherine came back it was all right again. Ferguson was\ndownstairs, she said. She was coming to lunch.\n\n“I knew you wouldn’t mind,” Catherine said.\n\n“No,” I said.\n\n“What’s the matter, darling?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“I know. You haven’t anything to do. All you have is me and I go away.”\n\n“That’s true.”\n\n“I’m sorry, darling. I know it must be a dreadful feeling to have\nnothing at all suddenly.”\n\n“My life used to be full of everything,” I said. “Now if you aren’t with\nme I haven’t a thing in the world.”\n\n“But I’ll be with you. I was only gone for two hours. Isn’t there\nanything you can do?”\n\n“I went fishing with the barman.”\n\n“Wasn’t it fun?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Don’t think about me when I’m not here.”\n\n“That’s the way I worked it at the front. But there was something to do\nthen.”\n\n“Othello with his occupation gone,” she teased.\n\n“Othello was a nigger,” I said. “Besides, I’m not jealous. I’m just so\nin love with you that there isn’t anything else.”\n\n“Will you be a good boy and be nice to Ferguson?”\n\n“I’m always nice to Ferguson unless she curses me.”"}
{"text": "“Be nice to her. Think how much we have and she hasn’t anything.”\n\n“I don’t think she wants what we have.”\n\n“You don’t know much, darling, for such a wise boy.”\n\n“I’ll be nice to her.”\n\n“I know you will. You’re so sweet.”\n\n“She won’t stay afterward, will she?”\n\n“No. I’ll get rid of her.”\n\n“And then we’ll come up here.”\n\n“Of course. What do you think I want to do?”\n\nWe went downstairs to have lunch with Ferguson. She was very impressed\nby the hotel and the splendor of the dining-room. We had a good lunch\nwith a couple of bottles of white capri. Count Greffi came into the\ndining-room and bowed to us. His niece, who looked a little like my\ngrandmother, was with him. I told Catherine and Ferguson about him and\nFerguson was very impressed. The hotel was very big and grand and empty\nbut the food was good, the wine was very pleasant and finally the wine\nmade us all feel very well. Catherine had no need to feel any better.\nShe was very happy. Ferguson became quite cheerful. I felt very well\nmyself. After lunch Ferguson went back to her hotel. She was going to\nlie down for a while after lunch she said.\n\nAlong late in the afternoon some one knocked on our door.\n\n“Who is it?”\n\n“The Count Greffi wishes to know if you will play billiards with him.”\n\nI looked at my watch; I had taken it off and it was under the pillow.\n\n“Do you have to go, darling?” Catherine whispered.\n\n“I think I’d better.” The watch was a quarter-past four o’clock. Out\nloud I said, “Tell the Count Greffi I will be in the billiard-room at\nfive o’clock.”\n\nAt a quarter to five I kissed Catherine good-by and went into the\nbathroom to dress. Knotting my tie and looking in the glass I looked\nstrange to myself in the civilian clothes. I must remember to buy some\nmore shirts and socks.\n\n“Will you be away a long time?” Catherine asked. She looked lovely in\nthe bed. “Would you hand me the brush?”\n\nI watched her brushing her hair, holding her head so the weight of her\nhair all came on one side. It was dark outside and the light over the\nhead of the bed shone on her hair and on her neck and shoulders. I went\nover and kissed her and held her hand with the brush and her head sunk\nback on the pillow. I kissed her neck and shoulders. I felt faint with\nloving her so much.\n\n“I don’t want to go away.”\n\n“I don’t want you to go away.”\n\n“I won’t go then.”\n\n“Yes. Go. It’s only for a little while and then you’ll come back.”\n\n“We’ll have dinner up here.”\n\n“Hurry and come back.”\n\nI found the Count Greffi in the billiard-room. He was practising\nstrokes, looking very fragile under the light that came down above the\nbilliard table. On a card table a little way beyond the light was a\nsilver icing-bucket with the necks and corks of two champagne bottles\nshowing above the ice. The Count Greffi straightened up when I came\ntoward the table and walked toward me. He put out his hand, “It is such\na great pleasure that you are here. You were very kind to come to play\nwith me.”\n\n“It was very nice of you to ask me.”\n\n“Are you quite well? They told me you were wounded on the Isonzo. I hope\nyou are well again.”\n\n“I’m very well. Have you been well?”\n\n“Oh, I am always well. But I am getting old. I detect signs of age now.”\n\n“I can’t believe it.”\n\n“Yes. Do you want to know one? It is easier for me to talk Italian. I\ndiscipline myself but I find when I am tired that it is so much easier\nto talk Italian. So I know I must be getting old.”\n\n“We could talk Italian. I am a little tired too.”\n\n“Oh, but when you are tired it will be easier for you to talk English.”\n\n“American.”\n\n“Yes. American. You will please talk American. It is a delightful\nlanguage.”\n\n“I hardly ever see Americans.”\n\n“You must miss them. One misses one’s countrymen and especially one’s\ncountrywomen. I know that experience. Should we play or are you too\ntired?”\n\n“I’m not really tired. I said that for a joke. What handicap will you\ngive me?”\n\n“Have you been playing very much?”\n\n“None at all.”\n\n“You play very well. Ten points in a hundred?”\n\n“You flatter me.”\n\n“Fifteen?”\n\n“That would be fine but you will beat me.”\n\n“Should we play for a stake? You always wished to play for a stake.”\n\n“I think we’d better.”\n\n“All right. I will give you eighteen points and we will play for a franc\na point.”"}
{"text": "He played a lovely game of billiards and with the handicap I was only\nfour ahead at fifty. Count Greffi pushed a button on the wall to ring\nfor the barman.\n\n“Open one bottle please,” he said. Then to me, “We will take a little\nstimulant.” The wine was icy cold and very dry and good.\n\n“Should we talk Italian? Would you mind very much? It is my great\nweakness now.”\n\nWe went on playing, sipping the wine between shots, speaking in Italian,\nbut talking little, concentrated on the game. Count Greffi made his one\nhundredth point and with the handicap I was only at ninety-four. He\nsmiled and patted me on the shoulder.\n\n“Now we will drink the other bottle and you will tell me about the war.”\nHe waited for me to sit down.\n\n“About anything else,” I said.\n\n“You don’t want to talk about it? Good. What have you been reading?”\n\n“Nothing,” I said. “I’m afraid I am very dull.”\n\n“No. But you should read.”\n\n“What is there written in war-time?”\n\n“There is ‘Le Feu’ by a Frenchman, Barbusse. There is ‘Mr. Britling Sees\nThrough It.’”\n\n“No, he doesn’t.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“He doesn’t see through it. Those books were at the hospital.”\n\n“Then you have been reading?”\n\n“Yes, but nothing any good.”\n\n“I thought ‘Mr. Britling’ a very good study of the English middle-class\nsoul.”\n\n“I don’t know about the soul.”\n\n“Poor boy. We none of us know about the soul. Are you _Croyant_?”\n\n“At night.”\n\nCount Greffi smiled and turned the glass with his fingers. “I had\nexpected to become more devout as I grow older but somehow I haven’t,”\nhe said. “It is a great pity.”\n\n“Would you like to live after death?” I asked and instantly felt a fool\nto mention death. But he did not mind the word.\n\n“It would depend on the life. This life is very pleasant. I would like\nto live forever,” he smiled. “I very nearly have.”\n\nWe were sitting in the deep leather chairs, the champagne in the\nice-bucket and our glasses on the table between us.\n\n“If you ever live to be as old as I am you will find many things\nstrange.”\n\n“You never seem old.”\n\n“It is the body that is old. Sometimes I am afraid I will break off a\nfinger as one breaks a stick of chalk. And the spirit is no older and\nnot much wiser.”\n\n“You are wise.”\n\n“No, that is the great fallacy; the wisdom of old men. They do not grow\nwise. They grow careful.”\n\n“Perhaps that is wisdom.”\n\n“It is a very unattractive wisdom. What do you value most?”\n\n“Some one I love.”\n\n“With me it is the same. That is not wisdom. Do you value life?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“So do I. Because it is all I have. And to give birthday parties,” he\nlaughed. “You are probably wiser than I am. You do not give birthday\nparties.”\n\nWe both drank the wine.\n\n“What do you think of the war really?” I asked.\n\n“I think it is stupid.”\n\n“Who will win it?”\n\n“Italy.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“They are a younger nation.”\n\n“Do younger nations always win wars?”\n\n“They are apt to for a time.”\n\n“Then what happens?”\n\n“They become older nations.”\n\n“You said you were not wise.”\n\n“Dear boy, that is not wisdom. That is cynicism.”\n\n“It sounds very wise to me.”\n\n“It’s not particularly. I could quote you the examples on the other\nside. But it is not bad. Have we finished the champagne?”\n\n“Almost.”\n\n“Should we drink some more? Then I must dress.”\n\n“Perhaps we’d better not now.”\n\n“You are sure you don’t want more?”\n\n“Yes.” He stood up.\n\n“I hope you will be very fortunate and very happy and very, very\nhealthy.”\n\n“Thank you. And I hope you will live forever.”\n\n“Thank you. I have. And if you ever become devout pray for me if I am\ndead. I am asking several of my friends to do that. I had expected to\nbecome devout myself but it has not come.” I thought he smiled sadly but\nI could not tell. He was so old and his face was very wrinkled, so that\na smile used so many lines that all gradations were lost.\n\n“I might become very devout,” I said. “Anyway, I will pray for you.”\n\n“I had always expected to become devout. All my family died very devout.\nBut somehow it does not come.”\n\n“It’s too early.”\n\n“Maybe it is too late. Perhaps I have outlived my religious feeling.”\n\n“My own comes only at night.”\n\n“Then too you are in love. Do not forget that is a religious feeling.”\n\n“You believe so?”\n\n“Of course.” He took a step toward the table. “You were very kind to\nplay.”\n\n“It was a great pleasure.”\n\n“We will walk upstairs together.”"}
{"text": "That night there was a storm and I woke to hear the rain lashing the\nwindow-panes. It was coming in the open window. Some one had knocked on\nthe door. I went to the door very softly, not to disturb Catherine, and\nopened it. The barman stood there. He wore his overcoat and carried his\nwet hat.\n\n“Can I speak to you, Tenente?”\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“It’s a very serious matter.”\n\nI looked around. The room was dark. I saw the water on the floor from\nthe window. “Come in,” I said. I took him by the arm into the bathroom;\nlocked the door and put on the light. I sat down on the edge of the\nbathtub.\n\n“What’s the matter, Emilio? Are you in trouble?”\n\n“No. You are, Tenente.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“They are going to arrest you in the morning.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“I came to tell you. I was out in the town and I heard them talking in a\ncafé.”\n\n“I see.”\n\nHe stood there, his coat wet, holding his wet hat and said nothing.\n\n“Why are they going to arrest me?”\n\n“For something about the war.”\n\n“Do you know what?”\n\n“No. But I know that they know you were here before as an officer and\nnow you are here out of uniform. After this retreat they arrest\neverybody.”\n\nI thought a minute.\n\n“What time do they come to arrest me?”\n\n“In the morning. I don’t know the time.”\n\n“What do you say to do?”\n\nHe put his hat in the washbowl. It was very wet and had been dripping on\nthe floor.\n\n“If you have nothing to fear an arrest is nothing. But it is always bad\nto be arrested—especially now.”\n\n“I don’t want to be arrested.”\n\n“Then go to Switzerland.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“In my boat.”\n\n“There is a storm,” I said.\n\n“The storm is over. It is rough but you will be all right.”\n\n“When should we go?”\n\n“Right away. They might come to arrest you early in the morning.”\n\n“What about our bags?”\n\n“Get them packed. Get your lady dressed. I will take care of them.”\n\n“Where will you be?”\n\n“I will wait here. I don’t want any one to see me outside in the hall.”\n\nI opened the door, closed it, and went into the bedroom. Catherine was\nawake.\n\n“What is it, darling?”\n\n“It’s all right, Cat,” I said. “Would you like to get dressed right away\nand go in a boat to Switzerland?”\n\n“Would you?”\n\n“No,” I said. “I’d like to go back to bed.”\n\n“What is it about?”\n\n“The barman says they are going to arrest me in the morning.”\n\n“Is the barman crazy?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then please hurry, darling, and get dressed so we can start.” She sat\nup on the side of the bed. She was still sleepy. “Is that the barman in\nthe bathroom?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then I won’t wash. Please look the other way, darling, and I’ll be\ndressed in just a minute.”\n\nI saw her white back as she took off her nightgown and then I looked\naway because she wanted me to. She was beginning to be a little big with\nthe child and she did not want me to see her. I dressed hearing the rain\non the windows. I did not have much to put in my bag.\n\n“There’s plenty of room in my bag, Cat, if you need any.”\n\n“I’m almost packed,” she said. “Darling, I’m awfully stupid, but why is\nthe barman in the bathroom?”\n\n“Sh—he’s waiting to take our bags down.”\n\n“He’s awfully nice.”\n\n“He’s an old friend,” I said. “I nearly sent him some pipe-tobacco\nonce.”\n\nI looked out the open window at the dark night. I could not see the\nlake, only the dark and the rain but the wind was quieter.\n\n“I’m ready, darling,” Catherine said.\n\n“All right.” I went to the bathroom door. “Here are the bags, Emilio,” I\nsaid. The barman took the two bags.\n\n“You’re very good to help us,” Catherine said.\n\n“That’s nothing, lady,” the barman said. “I’m glad to help you just so I\ndon’t get in trouble myself. Listen,” he said to me. “I’ll take these\nout the servants’ stairs and to the boat. You just go out as though you\nwere going for a walk.”\n\n“It’s a lovely night for a walk,” Catherine said.\n\n“It’s a bad night all right.”\n\n“I’m glad I’ve an umbrella,” Catherine said.\n\nWe walked down the hall and down the wide thickly carpeted stairs. At\nthe foot of the stairs by the door the porter sat behind his desk.\n\nHe looked surprised at seeing us.\n\n“You’re not going out, sir?” he said.\n\n“Yes,” I said. “We’re going to see the storm along the lake.”\n\n“Haven’t you got an umbrella, sir?”\n\n“No,” I said. “This coat sheds water.”"}
{"text": "He looked at it doubtfully. “I’ll get you an umbrella, sir,” he said. He\nwent away and came back with a big umbrella. “It is a little big, sir,”\nhe said. I gave him a ten-lira note. “Oh you are too good, sir. Thank\nyou very much,” he said. He held the door open and we went out into the\nrain. He smiled at Catherine and she smiled at him. “Don’t stay out in\nthe storm,” he said. “You will get wet, sir and lady.” He was only the\nsecond porter, and his English was still literally translated.\n\n“We’ll be back,” I said. We walked down the path under the giant\numbrella and out through the dark wet gardens to the road and across the\nroad to the trellised pathway along the lake. The wind was blowing\noffshore now. It was a cold, wet November wind and I knew it was snowing\nin the mountains. We came along past the chained boats in the slips\nalong the quay to where the barman’s boat should be. The water was dark\nagainst the stone. The barman stepped out from beside the row of trees.\n\n“The bags are in the boat,” he said.\n\n“I want to pay you for the boat,” I said.\n\n“How much money have you?”\n\n“Not so much.”\n\n“You send me the money later. That will be all right.”\n\n“How much?”\n\n“What you want.”\n\n“Tell me how much.”\n\n“If you get through send me five hundred francs. You won’t mind that if\nyou get through.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Here are sandwiches.” He handed me a package. “Everything there was in\nthe bar. It’s all here. This is a bottle of brandy and a bottle of\nwine.” I put them in my bag. “Let me pay you for those.”\n\n“All right, give me fifty lire.”\n\nI gave it to him. “The brandy is good,” he said. “You don’t need to be\nafraid to give it to your lady. She better get in the boat.” He held the\nboat, it rising and falling against the stone wall and I helped\nCatherine in. She sat in the stern and pulled her cape around her.\n\n“You know where to go?”\n\n“Up the lake.”\n\n“You know how far?”\n\n“Past Luino.”\n\n“Past Luino, Cannero, Cannobio, Tranzano. You aren’t in Switzerland\nuntil you come to Brissago. You have to pass Monte Tamara.”\n\n“What time is it?” Catherine asked.\n\n“It’s only eleven o’clock,” I said.\n\n“If you row all the time you ought to be there by seven o’clock in the\nmorning.”\n\n“Is it that far?”\n\n“It’s thirty-five kilometres.”\n\n“How should we go? In this rain we need a compass.”\n\n“No. Row to Isola Bella. Then on the other side of Isola Madre go with\nthe wind. The wind will take you to Pallanza. You will see the lights.\nThen go up the shore.”\n\n“Maybe the wind will change.”\n\n“No,” he said. “This wind will blow like this for three days. It comes\nstraight down from the Mattarone. There is a can to bail with.”\n\n“Let me pay you something for the boat now.”\n\n“No, I’d rather take a chance. If you get through you pay me all you\ncan.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“I don’t think you’ll get drowned.”\n\n“That’s good.”\n\n“Go with the wind up the lake.”\n\n“All right.” I stepped in the boat.\n\n“Did you leave the money for the hotel?”\n\n“Yes. In an envelope in the room.”\n\n“All right. Good luck, Tenente.”\n\n“Good luck. We thank you many times.”\n\n“You won’t thank me if you get drowned.”\n\n“What does he say?” Catherine asked.\n\n“He says good luck.”\n\n“Good luck,” Catherine said. “Thank you very much.”\n\n“Are you ready?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe bent down and shoved us off. I dug at the water with the oars, then\nwaved one hand. The barman waved back deprecatingly. I saw the lights of\nthe hotel and rowed out, rowing straight out until they were out of\nsight. There was quite a sea running but we were going with the wind.\n\nI rowed in the dark keeping the wind in my face. The rain had stopped\nand only came occasionally in gusts. It was very dark, and the wind was\ncold. I could see Catherine in the stern but I could not see the water\nwhere the blades of the oars dipped. The oars were long and there were\nno leathers to keep them from slipping out. I pulled, raised, leaned\nforward, found the water, dipped and pulled, rowing as easily as I\ncould. I did not feather the oars because the wind was with us. I knew\nmy hands would blister and I wanted to delay it as long as I could. The\nboat was light and rowed easily. I pulled it along in the dark water. I\ncould not see, and hoped we would soon come opposite Pallanza."}
{"text": "We never saw Pallanza. The wind was blowing up the lake and we passed\nthe point that hides Pallanza in the dark and never saw the lights. When\nwe finally saw some lights much further up the lake and close to the\nshore it was Intra. But for a long time we did not see any lights, nor\ndid we see the shore but rowed steadily in the dark riding with the\nwaves. Sometimes I missed the water with the oars in the dark as a wave\nlifted the boat. It was quite rough; but I kept on rowing, until\nsuddenly we were close ashore against a point of rock that rose beside\nus; the waves striking against it, rushing high up, then falling back. I\npulled hard on the right oar and backed water with the other and we went\nout into the lake again; the point was out of sight and we were going on\nup the lake.\n\n“We’re across the lake,” I said to Catherine.\n\n“Weren’t we going to see Pallanza?”\n\n“We’ve missed it.”\n\n“How are you, darling?”\n\n“I’m fine.”\n\n“I could take the oars awhile.”\n\n“No, I’m fine.”\n\n“Poor Ferguson,” Catherine said. “In the morning she’ll come to the\nhotel and find we’re gone.”\n\n“I’m not worrying so much about that,” I said, “as about getting into\nthe Swiss part of the lake before it’s daylight and the custom guards\nsee us.”\n\n“Is it a long way?”\n\n“It’s thirty some kilometres from here.”\n\nI rowed all night. Finally my hands were so sore I could hardly close\nthem over the oars. We were nearly smashed up on the shore several\ntimes. I kept fairly close to the shore because I was afraid of getting\nlost on the lake and losing time. Sometimes we were so close we could\nsee a row of trees and the road along the shore with the mountains\nbehind. The rain stopped and the wind drove the clouds so that the moon\nshone through and looking back I could see the long dark point of\nCastagnola and the lake with white-caps and beyond, the moon on the high\nsnow mountains. Then the clouds came over the moon again and the\nmountains and the lake were gone, but it was much lighter than it had\nbeen before and we could see the shore. I could see it too clearly and\npulled out where they would not see the boat if there were custom guards\nalong the Pallanza road. When the moon came out again we could see white\nvillas on the shore on the slopes of the mountain and the white road\nwhere it showed through the trees. All the time I was rowing.\n\nThe lake widened and across it on the shore at the foot of the mountains\non the other side we saw a few lights that should be Luino. I saw a\nwedgelike gap between the mountains on the other shore and I thought\nthat must be Luino. If it was we were making good time. I pulled in the\noars and lay back on the seat. I was very, very tired of rowing. My arms\nand shoulders and back ached and my hands were sore.\n\n“I could hold the umbrella,” Catherine said. “We could sail with that\nwith the wind.”\n\n“Can you steer?”\n\n“I think so.”\n\n“You take this oar and hold it under your arm close to the side of the\nboat and steer and I’ll hold the umbrella.” I went back to the stern and\nshowed her how to hold the oar. I took the big umbrella the porter had\ngiven me and sat facing the bow and opened it. It opened with a clap. I\nheld it on both sides, sitting astride the handle hooked over the seat.\nThe wind was full in it and I felt the boat suck forward while I held as\nhard as I could to the two edges. It pulled hard. The boat was moving\nfast.\n\n“We’re going beautifully,” Catherine said. All I could see was umbrella\nribs. The umbrella strained and pulled and I felt us driving along with\nit. I braced my feet and held back on it, then suddenly, it buckled; I\nfelt a rib snap on my forehead, I tried to grab the top that was bending\nwith the wind and the whole thing buckled and went inside-out and I was\nastride the handle of an inside-out, ripped umbrella, where I had been\nholding a wind-filled pulling sail. I unhooked the handle from the seat,\nlaid the umbrella in the bow and went back to Catherine for the oar. She\nwas laughing. She took my hand and kept on laughing.\n\n“What’s the matter?” I took the oar.\n\n“You looked so funny holding that thing.”\n\n“I suppose so.”"}
{"text": "“Don’t be cross, darling. It was awfully funny. You looked about twenty\nfeet broad and very affectionate holding the umbrella by the edges—”\nshe choked.\n\n“I’ll row.”\n\n“Take a rest and a drink. It’s a grand night and we’ve come a long way.”\n\n“I have to keep the boat out of the trough of the waves.”\n\n“I’ll get you a drink. Then rest a little while, darling.”\n\nI held the oars up and we sailed with them. Catherine was opening the\nbag. She handed me the brandy bottle. I pulled the cork with my\npocket-knife and took a long drink. It was smooth and hot and the heat\nwent all through me and I felt warmed and cheerful. “It’s lovely\nbrandy,” I said. The moon was under again but I could see the shore.\nThere seemed to be another point going out a long way ahead into the\nlake.\n\n“Are you warm enough, Cat?”\n\n“I’m splendid. I’m a little stiff.”\n\n“Bail out that water and you can put your feet down.”\n\nThen I rowed and listened to the oarlocks and the dip and scrape of the\nbailing tin under the stern seat.\n\n“Would you give me the bailer?” I said. “I want a drink.”\n\n“It’s awfully dirty.”\n\n“That’s all right. I’ll rinse it.”\n\nI heard Catherine rinsing it over the side. Then she handed it to me\ndipped full of water. I was thirsty after the brandy and the water was\nicy cold, so cold it made my teeth ache. I looked toward the shore. We\nwere closer to the long point. There were lights in the bay ahead.\n\n“Thanks,” I said and handed back the tin pail.\n\n“You’re ever so welcome,” Catherine said. “There’s much more if you want\nit.”\n\n“Don’t you want to eat something?”\n\n“No. I’ll be hungry in a little while. We’ll save it till then.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nWhat looked like a point ahead was a long high headland. I went further\nout in the lake to pass it. The lake was much narrower now. The moon was\nout again and the _guardia di Finanza_ could have seen our boat black on\nthe water if they had been watching.\n\n“How are you, Cat?” I asked.\n\n“I’m all right. Where are we?”\n\n“I don’t think we have more than about eight miles more.”\n\n“That’s a long way to row, you poor sweet. Aren’t you dead?”\n\n“No. I’m all right. My hands are sore is all.”\n\nWe went on up the lake. There was a break in the mountains on the right\nbank, a flattening-out with a low shore-line that I thought must be\nCannobio. I stayed a long way out because it was from now on that we ran\nthe most danger of meeting _guardia_. There was a high dome-capped\nmountain on the other shore a way ahead. I was tired. It was no great\ndistance to row but when you were out of condition it had been a long\nway. I knew I had to pass that mountain and go up the lake at least five\nmiles further before we would be in Swiss water. The moon was almost\ndown now but before it went down the sky clouded over again and it was\nvery dark. I stayed well out in the lake, rowing awhile, then resting\nand holding the oars so that the wind struck the blades.\n\n“Let me row awhile,” Catherine said.\n\n“I don’t think you ought to.”\n\n“Nonsense. It would be good for me. It would keep me from being too\nstiff.”\n\n“I don’t think you should, Cat.”\n\n“Nonsense. Rowing in moderation is very good for the pregnant lady.”\n\n“All right, you row a little moderately. I’ll go back, then you come up.\nHold on to both gunwales when you come up.”\n\nI sat in the stern with my coat on and the collar turned up and watched\nCatherine row. She rowed very well but the oars were too long and\nbothered her. I opened the bag and ate a couple of sandwiches and took a\ndrink of the brandy. It made everything much better and I took another\ndrink.\n\n“Tell me when you’re tired,” I said. Then a little later, “watch out the\noar doesn’t pop you in the tummy.”\n\n“If it did”—Catherine said between strokes—“life might be much\nsimpler.”\n\nI took another drink of the brandy.\n\n“How are you going?”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Tell me when you want to stop.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nI took another drink of the brandy, then took hold of the two gunwales\nof the boat and moved forward.\n\n“No. I’m going beautifully.”\n\n“Go on back to the stern. I’ve had a grand rest.”"}
{"text": "For a while, with the brandy, I rowed easily and steadily. Then I began\nto catch crabs and soon I was just chopping along again with a thin\nbrown taste of bile from having rowed too hard after the brandy.\n\n“Give me a drink of water, will you?” I said.\n\n“That’s easy,” Catherine said.\n\nBefore daylight it started to drizzle. The wind was down or we were\nprotected by mountains that bounded the curve the lake had made. When I\nknew daylight was coming I settled down and rowed hard. I did not know\nwhere we were and I wanted to get into the Swiss part of the lake. When\nit was beginning to be daylight we were quite close to the shore. I\ncould see the rocky shore and the trees.\n\n“What’s that?” Catherine said. I rested on the oars and listened. It was\na motor boat chugging out on the lake. I pulled close up to the shore\nand lay quiet. The chugging came closer; then we saw the motor boat in\nthe rain a little astern of us. There were four _guardia_ _di finanza_\nin the stern, their _alpini_ hats pulled down, their cape collars turned\nup and their carbines slung across their backs. They all looked sleepy\nso early in the morning. I could see the yellow on their hats and the\nyellow marks on their cape collars. The motor boat chugged on and out of\nsight in the rain.\n\nI pulled out into the lake. If we were that close to the border I did\nnot want to be hailed by a sentry along the road. I stayed out where I\ncould just see the shore and rowed on for three-quarters of an hour in\nthe rain. We heard a motor boat once more but I kept quiet until the\nnoise of the engine went away across the lake.\n\n“I think we’re in Switzerland, Cat,” I said.\n\n“Really?”\n\n“There’s no way to know until we see Swiss troops.”\n\n“Or the Swiss navy.”\n\n“The Swiss navy’s no joke for us. That last motor boat we heard was\nprobably the Swiss navy.”\n\n“If we’re in Switzerland let’s have a big breakfast. They have wonderful\nrolls and butter and jam in Switzerland.”\n\nIt was clear daylight now and a fine rain was falling. The wind was\nstill blowing outside up the lake and we could see the tops of the\nwhite-caps going away from us and up the lake. I was sure we were in\nSwitzerland now. There were many houses back in the trees from the shore\nand up the shore a way was a village with stone houses, some villas on\nthe hills and a church. I had been looking at the road that skirted the\nshore for guards but did not see any. The road came quite close to the\nlake now and I saw a soldier coming out of a café on the road. He wore a\ngray-green uniform and a helmet like the Germans. He had a\nhealthy-looking face and a little toothbrush mustache. He looked at us.\n\n“Wave to him,” I said to Catherine. She waved and the soldier smiled\nembarrassedly and gave a wave of his hand. I eased up rowing. We were\npassing the waterfront of the village.\n\n“We must be well inside the border,” I said.\n\n“We want to be sure, darling. We don’t want them to turn us back at the\nfrontier.”\n\n“The frontier is a long way back. I think this is the customs town. I’m\npretty sure it’s Brissago.”\n\n“Won’t there be Italians there? There are always both sides at a customs\ntown.”\n\n“Not in war-time. I don’t think they let the Italians cross the\nfrontier.”\n\nIt was a nice-looking little town. There were many fishing boats along\nthe quay and nets were spread on racks. There was a fine November rain\nfalling but it looked cheerful and clean even with the rain.\n\n“Should we land then and have breakfast?”\n\n“All right.”\n\nI pulled hard on the left oar and came in close, then straightened out\nwhen we were close to the quay and brought the boat alongside. I pulled\nin the oars, took hold of an iron ring, stepped up on the wet stone and\nwas in Switzerland. I tied the boat and held my hand down to Catherine.\n\n“Come on up, Cat. It’s a grand feeling.”\n\n“What about the bags?”\n\n“Leave them in the boat.”\n\nCatherine stepped up and we were in Switzerland together.\n\n“What a lovely country,” she said.\n\n“Isn’t it grand?”\n\n“Let’s go and have breakfast!”\n\n“Isn’t it a grand country? I love the way it feels under my shoes.”\n\n“I’m so stiff I can’t feel it very well. But it feels like a splendid\ncountry. Darling, do you realize we’re here and out of that bloody\nplace?”"}
{"text": "“I do. I really do. I’ve never realized anything before.”\n\n“Look at the houses. Isn’t this a fine square? There’s a place we can\nget breakfast.”\n\n“Isn’t the rain fine? They never had rain like this in Italy. It’s\ncheerful rain.”\n\n“And we’re here, darling! Do you realize we’re here?”\n\nWe went inside the café and sat down at a clean wooden table. We were\ncockeyed excited. A splendid clean-looking woman with an apron came and\nasked us what we wanted.\n\n“Rolls and jam and coffee,” Catherine said.\n\n“I’m sorry, we haven’t any rolls in war-time.”\n\n“Bread then.”\n\n“I can make you some toast.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“I want some eggs fried too.”\n\n“How many eggs for the gentleman?”\n\n“Three.”\n\n“Take four, darling.”\n\n“Four eggs.”\n\nThe woman went away. I kissed Catherine and held her hand very tight. We\nlooked at each other and at the café.\n\n“Darling, darling, isn’t it lovely?”\n\n“It’s grand,” I said.\n\n“I don’t mind there not being rolls,” Catherine said. “I thought about\nthem all night. But I don’t mind it. I don’t mind it at all.”\n\n“I suppose pretty soon they will arrest us.”\n\n“Never mind, darling. We’ll have breakfast first. You won’t mind being\narrested after breakfast. And then there’s nothing they can do to us.\nWe’re British and American citizens in good standing.”\n\n“You have a passport, haven’t you?”\n\n“Of course. Oh let’s not talk about it. Let’s be happy.”\n\n“I couldn’t be any happier,” I said. A fat gray cat with a tail that\nlifted like a plume crossed the floor to our table and curved against my\nleg to purr each time she rubbed. I reached down and stroked her.\nCatherine smiled at me very happily. “Here comes the coffee,” she said.\n\nThey arrested us after breakfast. We took a little walk through the\nvillage then went down to the quay to get our bags. A soldier was\nstanding guard over the boat.\n\n“Is this your boat?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Where do you come from?”\n\n“Up the lake.”\n\n“Then I have to ask you to come with me.”\n\n“How about the bags?”\n\n“You can carry the bags.”\n\nI carried the bags and Catherine walked beside me and the soldier walked\nalong behind us to the old custom house. In the custom house a\nlieutenant, very thin and military, questioned us.\n\n“What nationality are you?”\n\n“American and British.”\n\n“Let me see your passports.”\n\nI gave him mine and Catherine got hers out of her handbag.\n\nHe examined them for a long time.\n\n“Why do you enter Switzerland this way in a boat?”\n\n“I am a sportsman,” I said. “Rowing is my great sport. I always row when\nI get a chance.”\n\n“Why do you come here?”\n\n“For the winter sport. We are tourists and we want to do the winter\nsport.”\n\n“This is no place for winter sport.”\n\n“We know it. We want to go where they have the winter sport.”\n\n“What have you been doing in Italy?”\n\n“I have been studying architecture. My cousin has been studying art.”\n\n“Why do you leave there?”\n\n“We want to do the winter sport. With the war going on you cannot study\narchitecture.”\n\n“You will please stay where you are,” the lieutenant said. He went back\ninto the building with our passports.\n\n“You’re splendid, darling,” Catherine said. “Keep on the same track. You\nwant to do the winter sport.”\n\n“Do you know anything about art?”\n\n“Rubens,” said Catherine.\n\n“Large and fat,” I said.\n\n“Titian,” Catherine said.\n\n“Titian-haired,” I said. “How about Mantegna?”\n\n“Don’t ask hard ones,” Catherine said. “I know him though—very bitter.”\n\n“Very bitter,” I said. “Lots of nail holes.”\n\n“You see I’ll make you a fine wife,” Catherine said. “I’ll be able to\ntalk art with your customers.”\n\n“Here he comes,” I said. The thin lieutenant came down the length of the\ncustom house, holding our passports.\n\n“I will have to send you into Locarno,” he said. “You can get a carriage\nand a soldier will go in with you.”\n\n“All right,” I said. “What about the boat?”\n\n“The boat is confiscated. What have you in those bags?”\n\nHe went all through the two bags and held up the quarter-bottle of\nbrandy. “Would you join me in a drink?” I asked.\n\n“No thank you.” He straightened up. “How much money have you?”\n\n“Twenty-five hundred lire.”\n\nHe was favorably impressed. “How much has your cousin?”\n\nCatherine had a little over twelve hundred lire. The lieutenant was\npleased. His attitude toward us became less haughty."}
{"text": "“If you are going for winter sports,” he said, “Wengen is the place. My\nfather has a very fine hotel at Wengen. It is open all the time.”\n\n“That’s splendid,” I said. “Could you give me the name?”\n\n“I will write it on a card.” He handed me the card very politely.\n\n“The soldier will take you in to Locarno. He will keep your passports. I\nregret this but it is necessary. I have good hopes they will give you a\nvisa or a police permit at Locarno.”\n\nHe handed the two passports to the soldier and carrying the bags we\nstarted into the village to order a carriage. “Hi,” the lieutenant\ncalled to the soldier. He said something in a German dialect to him. The\nsoldier slung his rifle on his back and picked up the bags.\n\n“It’s a great country,” I said to Catherine.\n\n“It’s so practical.”\n\n“Thank you very much,” I said to the lieutenant. He waved his hand.\n\n_“Service!_” he said. We followed our guard into the village.\n\nWe drove to Locarno in a carriage with the soldier sitting on the front\nseat with the driver. At Locarno we did not have a bad time. They\nquestioned us but they were polite because we had passports and money. I\ndo not think they believed a word of the story and I thought it was\nsilly but it was like a law-court. You did not want something\nreasonable, you wanted something technical and then stuck to it without\nexplanations. But we had passports and we would spend the money. So they\ngave us provisional visas. At any time this visa might be withdrawn. We\nwere to report to the police wherever we went.\n\nCould we go wherever we wanted? Yes. Where did we want to go?\n\n“Where do you want to go, Cat?”\n\n“Montreux.”\n\n“It is a very nice place,” the official said. “I think you will like\nthat place.”\n\n“Here at Locarno is a very nice place,” another official said. “I am\nsure you would like it here very much at Locarno. Locarno is a very\nattractive place.”\n\n“We would like some place where there is winter sport.”\n\n“There is no winter sport at Montreux.”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” the other official said. “I come from Montreux.\nThere is very certainly winter sport on the Montreux Oberland Bernois\nrailway. It would be false for you to deny that.”\n\n“I do not deny it. I simply said there is no winter sport at Montreux.”\n\n“I question that,” the other official said. “I question that statement.”\n\n“I hold to that statement.”\n\n“I question that statement. I myself have _luge-ed_ into the streets of\nMontreux. I have done it not once but several times. Luge-ing is\ncertainly winter sport.”\n\nThe other official turned to me.\n\n“Is luge-ing your idea of winter sport, sir? I tell you you would be\nvery comfortable here in Locarno. You would find the climate healthy,\nyou would find the environs attractive. You would like it very much.”\n\n“The gentleman has expressed a wish to go to Montreux.”\n\n“What is luge-ing?” I asked.\n\n“You see he has never even heard of luge-ing!”\n\nThat meant a great deal to the second official. He was pleased by that.\n\n“Luge-ing,” said the first official, “is tobogganing.”\n\n“I beg to differ,” the other official shook his head. “I must differ\nagain. The toboggan is very different from the luge. The toboggan is\nconstructed in Canada of flat laths. The luge is a common sled with\nrunners. Accuracy means something.”\n\n“Couldn’t we toboggan?” I asked.\n\n“Of course you could toboggan,” the first official said. “You could\ntoboggan very well. Excellent Canadian toboggans are sold in Montreux.\nOchs Brothers sell toboggans. They import their own toboggans.”\n\nThe second official turned away. “Tobogganing,” he said, “requires a\nspecial _piste_. You could not toboggan into the streets of Montreux.\nWhere are you stopping here?”\n\n“We don’t know,” I said. “We just drove in from Brissago. The carriage\nis outside.”\n\n“You make no mistake in going to Montreux,” the first official said.\n“You will find the climate delightful and beautiful. You will have no\ndistance to go for winter sport.”\n\n“If you really want winter sport,” the second official said, “you will\ngo to the Engadine or to Mürren. I must protest against your being\nadvised to go to Montreux for the winter sport.”"}
{"text": "“At Les Avants above Montreux there is excellent winter sport of every\nsort.” The champion of Montreux glared at his colleague.\n\n“Gentlemen,” I said, “I am afraid we must go. My cousin is very tired.\nWe will go tentatively to Montreux.”\n\n“I congratulate you,” the first official shook my hand.\n\n“I believe that you will regret leaving Locarno,” the second official\nsaid. “At any rate you will report to the police at Montreux.”\n\n“There will be no unpleasantness with the police,” the first official\nassured me. “You will find all the inhabitants extremely courteous and\nfriendly.”\n\n“Thank you both very much,” I said. “We appreciate your advice very\nmuch.”\n\n“Good-by,” Catherine said. “Thank you both very much.”\n\nThey bowed us to the door, the champion of Locarno a little coldly. We\nwent down the steps and into the carriage.\n\n“My God, darling,” Catherine said. “Couldn’t we have gotten away any\nsooner?” I gave the name of a hotel one of the officials had recommended\nto the driver. He picked up the reins.\n\n“You’ve forgotten the army,” Catherine said. The soldier was standing by\nthe carriage. I gave him a ten-lira note. “I have no Swiss money yet,” I\nsaid. He thanked me, saluted and went off. The carriage started and we\ndrove to the hotel.\n\n“How did you happen to pick out Montreux?” I asked Catherine. “Do you\nreally want to go there?”\n\n“It was the first place I could think of,” she said. “It’s not a bad\nplace. We can find some place up in the mountains.”\n\n“Are you sleepy?”\n\n“I’m asleep right now.”\n\n“We’ll get a good sleep. Poor Cat, you had a long bad night.”\n\n“I had a lovely time,” Catherine said. “Especially when you sailed with\nthe umbrella.”\n\n“Can you realize we’re in Switzerland?”\n\n“No, I’m afraid I’ll wake up and it won’t be true.”\n\n“I am too.”\n\n“It is true, isn’t it, darling? I’m not just driving down to the\n_stazione_ in Milan to see you off.”\n\n“I hope not.”\n\n“Don’t say that. It frightens me. Maybe that’s where we’re going.”\n\n“I’m so groggy I don’t know,” I said.\n\n“Let me see your hands.”\n\nI put them out. They were both blistered raw.\n\n“There’s no hole in my side,” I said.\n\n“Don’t be sacrilegious.”\n\nI felt very tired and vague in the head. The exhilaration was all gone.\nThe carriage was going along the street.\n\n“Poor hands,” Catherine said.\n\n“Don’t touch them,” I said. “By God I don’t know where we are. Where are\nwe going, driver?” The driver stopped his horse.\n\n“To the Hotel Metropole. Don’t you want to go there?”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “It’s all right, Cat.”\n\n“It’s all right, darling. Don’t be upset. We’ll get a good sleep and you\nwon’t feel groggy to-morrow.”\n\n“I get pretty groggy,” I said. “It’s like a comic opera to-day. Maybe\nI’m hungry.”\n\n“You’re just tired, darling. You’ll be fine.” The carriage pulled up\nbefore the hotel. Some one came out to take our bags.\n\n“I feel all right,” I said. We were down on the pavement going into the\nhotel.\n\n“I know you’ll be all right. You’re just tired. You’ve been up a long\ntime.”\n\n“Anyhow we’re here.”\n\n“Yes, we’re really here.”\n\nWe followed the boy with the bags into the hotel.\n\nThat fall the snow came very late. We lived in a brown wooden house in\nthe pine trees on the side of the mountain and at night there was frost\nso that there was thin ice over the water in the two pitchers on the\ndresser in the morning. Mrs. Guttingen came into the room early in the\nmorning to shut the windows and started a fire in the tall porcelain\nstove. The pine wood crackled and sparked and then the fire roared in\nthe stove and the second time Mrs. Guttingen came into the room she\nbrought big chunks of wood for the fire and a pitcher of hot water. When\nthe room was warm she brought in breakfast. Sitting up in bed eating\nbreakfast we could see the lake and the mountains across the lake on the\nFrench side. There was snow on the tops of the mountains and the lake\nwas a gray steel-blue."}
{"text": "Outside, in front of the chalet a road went up the mountain. The wheel\nruts and ridges were iron hard with the frost, and the road climbed\nsteadily through the forest and up and around the mountain to where\nthere were meadows, and barns and cabins in the meadows at the edge of\nthe woods looking across the valley. The valley was deep and there was a\nstream at the bottom that flowed down into the lake and when the wind\nblew across the valley you could hear the stream in the rocks.\n\nSometimes we went off the road and on a path through the pine forest.\nThe floor of the forest was soft to walk on; the frost did not harden it\nas it did the road. But we did not mind the hardness of the road because\nwe had nails in the soles and heels of our boots and the heel nails bit\non the frozen ruts and with nailed boots it was good walking on the road\nand invigorating. But it was lovely walking in the woods.\n\nIn front of the house where we lived the mountain went down steeply to\nthe little plain along the lake and we sat on the porch of the house in\nthe sun and saw the winding of the road down the mountain-side and the\nterraced vineyards on the side of the lower mountain, the vines all dead\nnow for the winter and the fields divided by stone walls, and below the\nvineyards the houses of the town on the narrow plain along the lake\nshore. There was an island with two trees on the lake and the trees\nlooked like the double sails of a fishing-boat. The mountains were sharp\nand steep on the other side of the lake and down at the end of the lake\nwas the plain of the Rhone Valley flat between the two ranges of\nmountains; and up the valley where the mountains cut it off was the Dent\ndu Midi. It was a high snowy mountain and it dominated the valley but it\nwas so far away that it did not make a shadow.\n\nWhen the sun was bright we ate lunch on the porch but the rest of the\ntime we ate upstairs in a small room with plain wooden walls and a big\nstove in the corner. We bought books and magazines in the town and a\ncopy of “Hoyle” and learned many two-handed card games. The small room\nwith the stove was our living-room. There were two comfortable chairs\nand a table for books and magazines and we played cards on the\ndining-table when it was cleared away. Mr. and Mrs. Guttingen lived\ndownstairs and we would hear them talking sometimes in the evening and\nthey were very happy together too. He had been a headwaiter and she had\nworked as maid in the same hotel and they had saved their money to buy\nthis place. They had a son who was studying to be a headwaiter. He was\nat a hotel in Zurich. Downstairs there was a parlor where they sold wine\nand beer, and sometimes in the evening we would hear carts stop outside\non the road and men come up the steps to go in the parlor to drink wine.\n\nThere was a box of wood in the hall outside the living-room and I kept\nup the fire from it. But we did not stay up very late. We went to bed in\nthe dark in the big bedroom and when I was undressed I opened the\nwindows and saw the night and the cold stars and the pine trees below\nthe window and then got into bed as fast as I could. It was lovely in\nbed with the air so cold and clear and the night outside the window. We\nslept well and if I woke in the night I knew it was from only one cause\nand I would shift the feather bed over, very softly so that Catherine\nwould not be wakened and then go back to sleep again, warm and with the\nnew lightness of thin covers. The war seemed as far away as the football\ngames of some one else’s college. But I knew from the papers that they\nwere still fighting in the mountains because the snow would not come."}
{"text": "Sometimes we walked down the mountain into Montreux. There was a path\nwent down the mountain but it was steep and so usually we took the road\nand walked down on the wide hard road between fields and then below\nbetween the stone walls of the vineyards and on down between the houses\nof the villages along the way. There were three villages; Chernex,\nFontanivent, and the other I forget. Then along the road we passed an\nold square-built stone château on a ledge on the side of the\nmountain-side with the terraced fields of vines, each vine tied to a\nstick to hold it up, the vines dry and brown and the earth ready for the\nsnow and the lake down below flat and gray as steel. The road went down\na long grade below the château and then turned to the right and went\ndown very steeply and paved with cobbles, into Montreux.\n\nWe did not know any one in Montreux. We walked along beside the lake and\nsaw the swans and the many gulls and terns that flew up when you came\nclose and screamed while they looked down at the water. Out on the lake\nthere were flocks of grebes, small and dark, and leaving trails in the\nwater when they swam. In the town we walked along the main street and\nlooked in the windows of the shops. There were many big hotels that were\nclosed but most of the shops were open and the people were very glad to\nsee us. There was a fine coiffeur’s place where Catherine went to have\nher hair done. The woman who ran it was very cheerful and the only\nperson we knew in Montreux. While Catherine was there I went up to a\nbeer place and drank dark Munich beer and read the papers. I read the\n_Corriere Della Sera_ and the English and American papers from Paris.\nAll the advertisements were blacked out, supposedly to prevent\ncommunication in that way with the enemy. The papers were bad reading.\nEverything was going very badly everywhere. I sat back in the corner\nwith a heavy mug of dark beer and an opened glazed-paper package of\npretzels and ate the pretzels for the salty flavor and the good way they\nmade the beer taste and read about disaster. I thought Catherine would\ncome by but she did not come, so I hung the papers back on the rack,\npaid for my beer and went up the street to look for her. The day was\ncold and dark and wintry and the stone of the houses looked cold.\nCatherine was still in the hair-dresser’s shop. The woman was waving her\nhair. I sat in the little booth and watched. It was exciting to watch\nand Catherine smiled and talked to me and my voice was a little thick\nfrom being excited. The tongs made a pleasant clicking sound and I could\nsee Catherine in three mirrors and it was pleasant and warm in the\nbooth. Then the woman put up Catherine’s hair, and Catherine looked in\nthe mirror and changed it a little, taking out and putting in pins; then\nstood up. “I’m sorry to have taken such a long time.”\n\n“Monsieur was very interested. Were you not, monsieur?” the woman\nsmiled.\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\nWe went out and up the street. It was cold and wintry and the wind was\nblowing. “Oh, darling, I love you so,” I said.\n\n“Don’t we have a fine time?” Catherine said. “Look. Let’s go some place\nand have beer instead of tea. It’s very good for young Catherine. It\nkeeps her small.”\n\n“Young Catherine,” I said. “That loafer.”\n\n“She’s been very good,” Catherine said. “She makes very little trouble.\nThe doctor says beer will be good for me and keep her small.”\n\n“If you keep her small enough and she’s a boy, maybe he will be a\njockey.”\n\n“I suppose if we really have this child we ought to get married,”\nCatherine said. We were in the beer place at the corner table. It was\ngetting dark outside. It was still early but the day was dark and the\ndusk was coming early.\n\n“Let’s get married now,” I said.\n\n“No,” Catherine said. “It’s too embarrassing now. I show too plainly. I\nwon’t go before any one and be married in this state.”\n\n“I wish we’d gotten married.”\n\n“I suppose it would have been better. But when could we, darling?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“I know one thing. I’m not going to be married in this splendid matronly\nstate.”\n\n“You’re not matronly.”"}
{"text": "“Oh yes, I am, darling. The hairdresser asked me if this was our first.\nI lied and said no, we had two boys and two girls.”\n\n“When will we be married?”\n\n“Any time after I’m thin again. We want to have a splendid wedding with\nevery one thinking what a handsome young couple.”\n\n“And you’re not worried?”\n\n“Darling, why should I be worried? The only time I ever felt badly was\nwhen I felt like a whore in Milan and that only lasted seven minutes and\nbesides it was the room furnishings. Don’t I make you a good wife?”\n\n“You’re a lovely wife.”\n\n“Then don’t be too technical, darling. I’ll marry you as soon as I’m\nthin again.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Do you think I ought to drink another beer? The doctor said I was\nrather narrow in the hips and it’s all for the best if we keep young\nCatherine small.”\n\n“What else did he say?” I was worried.\n\n“Nothing. I have a wonderful blood-pressure, darling. He admired my\nblood-pressure greatly.”\n\n“What did he say about you being too narrow in the hips?”\n\n“Nothing. Nothing at all. He said I shouldn’t ski.”\n\n“Quite right.”\n\n“He said it was too late to start if I’d never done it before. He said I\ncould ski if I wouldn’t fall down.”\n\n“He’s just a big-hearted joker.”\n\n“Really he was very nice. We’ll have him when the baby comes.”\n\n“Did you ask him if you ought to get married?”\n\n“No. I told him we’d been married four years. You see, darling, if I\nmarry you I’ll be an American and any time we’re married under American\nlaw the child is legitimate.”\n\n“Where did you find that out?”\n\n“In the New York _World Almanac_ in the library.”\n\n“You’re a grand girl.”\n\n“I’ll be very glad to be an American and we’ll go to America won’t we,\ndarling? I want to see Niagara Falls.”\n\n“You’re a fine girl.”\n\n“There’s something else I want to see but I can’t remember it.”\n\n“The stockyards?”\n\n“No. I can’t remember it.”\n\n“The Woolworth building?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“The Grand Canyon?”\n\n“No. But I’d like to see that.”\n\n“What was it?”\n\n“The Golden Gate! That’s what I want to see. Where is the Golden Gate?”\n\n“San Francisco.”\n\n“Then let’s go there. I want to see San Francisco anyway.”\n\n“All right. We’ll go there.”\n\n“Now let’s go up the mountain. Should we? Can we get the M. O. B.?”\n\n“There’s a train a little after five.”\n\n“Let’s get that.”\n\n“All right. I’ll drink one more beer first.”\n\nWhen we went out to go up the street and climb the stairs to the station\nit was very cold. A cold wind was coming down the Rhone valley. There\nwere lights in the shop windows and we climbed the steep stone stairway\nto the upper street, then up another stairs to the station. The electric\ntrain was there waiting, all the lights on. There was a dial that showed\nwhen it left. The clock hands pointed to ten minutes after five. I\nlooked at the station clock. It was five minutes after. As we got on\nboard I saw the motorman and conductor coming out of the station wine\nshop. We sat down and opened the window. The train was electrically\nheated and stuffy but fresh cold air came in through the window.\n\n“Are you tired, Cat?” I asked.\n\n“No. I feel splendid.”\n\n“It isn’t a long ride.”\n\n“I like the ride,” she said. “Don’t worry about me, darling. I feel\nfine.”\n\nSnow did not come until three days before Christmas. We woke one morning\nand it was snowing. We stayed in bed with the fire roaring in the stove\nand watched the snow fall. Mrs. Guttingen took away the breakfast trays\nand put more wood in the stove. It was a big snow storm. She said it had\nstarted about midnight. I went to the window and looked out but could\nnot see across the road. It was blowing and snowing wildly. I went back\nto bed and we lay and talked.\n\n“I wish I could ski,” Catherine said. “It’s rotten not to be able to\nski.”\n\n“We’ll get a bobsled and come down the road. That’s no worse for you\nthan riding in a car.”\n\n“Won’t it be rough?”\n\n“We can see.”\n\n“I hope it won’t be too rough.”\n\n“After a while we’ll take a walk in the snow.”\n\n“Before lunch,” Catherine said, “so we’ll have a good appetite.”\n\n“I’m always hungry.”\n\n“So am I.”"}
{"text": "We went out in the snow but it was drifted so that we could not walk\nfar. I went ahead and made a trail down to the station but when we\nreached there we had gone far enough. The snow was blowing so we could\nhardly see and we went into the little inn by the station and swept each\nother off with a broom and sat on a bench and had vermouths.\n\n“It is a big storm,” the barmaid said.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“The snow is very late this year.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Could I eat a chocolate bar?” Catherine asked. “Or is it too close to\nlunch? I’m always hungry.”\n\n“Go on and eat one,” I said.\n\n“I’ll take one with filberts,” Catherine said.\n\n“They are very good,” the girl said, “I like them the best.”\n\n“I’ll have another vermouth,” I said.\n\nWhen we came out to start back up the road our track was filled in by\nthe snow. There were only faint indentations where the holes had been.\nThe snow blew in our faces so we could hardly see. We brushed off and\nwent in to have lunch. Mr. Guttingen served the lunch.\n\n“To-morrow there will be skiing,” he said. “Do you ski, Mr. Henry?”\n\n“No. But I want to learn.”\n\n“You will learn very easily. My boy will be here for Christmas and he\nwill teach you.”\n\n“That’s fine. When does he come?”\n\n“To-morrow night.”\n\nWhen we were sitting by the stove in the little room after lunch looking\nout the window at the snow coming down Catherine said, “Wouldn’t you\nlike to go on a trip somewhere by yourself, darling, and be with men and\nski?”\n\n“No. Why should I?”\n\n“I should think sometimes you would want to see other people besides\nme.”\n\n“Do you want to see other people?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Neither do I.”\n\n“I know. But you’re different. I’m having a child and that makes me\ncontented not to do anything. I know I’m awfully stupid now and I talk\ntoo much and I think you ought to get away so you won’t be tired of me.\n\n“Do you want me to go away?”\n\n“No. I want you to stay.”\n\n“That’s what I’m going to do.”\n\n“Come over here,” she said. “I want to feel the bump on your head. It’s\na big bump.” She ran her finger over it. “Darling, would you like to\ngrow a beard?”\n\n“Would you like me to?”\n\n“It might be fun. I’d like to see you with a beard.”\n\n“All right. I’ll grow one. I’ll start now this minute. It’s a good idea.\nIt will give me something to do.”\n\n“Are you worried because you haven’t anything to do?”\n\n“No. I like it. I have a fine life. Don’t you?”\n\n“I have a lovely life. But I was afraid because I’m big now that maybe I\nwas a bore to you.”\n\n“Oh, Cat. You don’t know how crazy I am about you.”\n\n“This way?”\n\n“Just the way you are. I have a fine time. Don’t we have a good life?”\n\n“I do, but I thought maybe you were restless.”\n\n“No. Sometimes I wonder about the front and about people I know but I\ndon’t worry. I don’t think about anything much.”\n\n“Who do you wonder about?”\n\n“About Rinaldi and the priest and lots of people I know. But I don’t\nthink about them much. I don’t want to think about the war. I’m through\nwith it.”\n\n“What are you thinking about now?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Yes you were. Tell me.”\n\n“I was wondering whether Rinaldi had the syphilis.”\n\n“Was that all?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Has he the syphilis?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“I’m glad you haven’t. Did you ever have anything like that?”\n\n“I had gonorrhea.”\n\n“I don’t want to hear about it. Was it very painful, darling?”\n\n“Very.”\n\n“I wish I’d had it.”\n\n“No you don’t.”\n\n“I do. I wish I’d had it to be like you. I wish I’d stayed with all your\ngirls so I could make fun of them to you.”\n\n“That’s a pretty picture.”\n\n“It’s not a pretty picture you having gonorrhea.”\n\n“I know it. Look at it snow now.”\n\n“I’d rather look at you. Darling, why don’t you let your hair grow?”\n\n“How grow?”\n\n“Just grow a little longer.”\n\n“It’s long enough now.”\n\n“No, let it grow a little longer and I could cut mine and we’d be just\nalike only one of us blonde and one of us dark.”\n\n“I wouldn’t let you cut yours.”\n\n“It would be fun. I’m tired of it. It’s an awful nuisance in the bed at\nnight.”\n\n“I like it.”\n\n“Wouldn’t you like it short?”\n\n“I might. I like it the way it is.”\n\n“It might be nice short. Then we’d both be alike. Oh, darling, I want\nyou so much I want to be you too.”\n\n“You are. We’re the same one.”\n\n“I know it. At night we are.”\n\n“The nights are grand.”"}
{"text": "“I want us to be all mixed up. I don’t want you to go away. I just said\nthat. You go if you want to. But hurry right back. Why, darling, I don’t\nlive at all when I’m not with you.”\n\n“I won’t ever go away,” I said. “I’m no good when you’re not there. I\nhaven’t any life at all any more.”\n\n“I want you to have a life. I want you to have a fine life. But we’ll\nhave it together, won’t we?”\n\n“And now do you want me to stop growing my beard or let it go on?”\n\n“Go on. Grow it. It will be exciting. Maybe it will be done for New\nYear’s.”\n\n“Now do you want to play chess?”\n\n“I’d rather play with you.”\n\n“No. Let’s play chess.”\n\n“And afterward we’ll play?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nI got out the chess-board and arranged the pieces. It was still snowing\nhard outside.\n\nOne time in the night I woke up and knew that Catherine was awake too.\nThe moon was shining in the window and made shadows on the bed from the\nbars on the window-panes.\n\n“Are you awake, sweetheart?”\n\n“Yes. Can’t you sleep?”\n\n“I just woke up thinking about how I was nearly crazy when I first met\nyou. Do you remember?”\n\n“You were just a little crazy.”\n\n“I’m never that way any more. I’m grand now. You say grand so sweetly.\nSay grand.”\n\n“Grand.”\n\n“Oh, you’re sweet. And I’m not crazy now. I’m just very, very, very\nhappy.”\n\n“Go on to sleep,” I said.\n\n“All right. Let’s go to sleep at exactly the same moment.”\n\n“All right.”\n\nBut we did not. I was awake for quite a long time thinking about things\nand watching Catherine sleeping, the moonlight on her face. Then I went\nto sleep, too.\n\nBy the middle of January I had a beard and the winter had settled into\nbright cold days and hard cold nights. We could walk on the roads again.\nThe snow was packed hard and smooth by the hay-sleds and wood-sledges\nand the logs that were hauled down the mountain. The snow lay over all\nthe country, down almost to Montreux. The mountains on the other side of\nthe lake were all white and the plain of the Rhone valley was covered.\nWe took long walks on the other side of the mountain to the Bains de\nl’Alliaz. Catherine wore hobnailed boots and a cape and carried a stick\nwith a sharp steel point. She did not look big with the cape and we\nwould not walk too fast but stopped and sat on logs by the roadside to\nrest when she was tired.\n\nThere was an inn in the trees at the Bains de l’Alliaz where the\nwoodcutters stopped to drink, and we sat inside warmed by the stove and\ndrank hot red wine with spices and lemon in it. They called it\n_glühwein_ and it was a good thing to warm you and to celebrate with.\nThe inn was dark and smoky inside and afterward when you went out the\ncold air came sharply into your lungs and numbed the edge of your nose\nas you inhaled. We looked back at the inn with light coming from the\nwindows and the woodcutters’ horses stamping and jerking their heads\noutside to keep warm. There was frost on the hairs of their muzzles and\ntheir breathing made plumes of frost in the air. Going up the road\ntoward home the road was smooth and slippery for a while and the ice\norange from the horses until the wood-hauling track turned off. Then the\nroad was clean-packed snow and led through the woods, and twice coming\nhome in the evening, we saw foxes.\n\nIt was a fine country and every time that we went out it was fun.\n\n“You have a splendid beard now,” Catherine said. “It looks just like the\nwoodcutters’. Did you see the man with the tiny gold ear-rings?”\n\n“He’s a chamois hunter,” I said. “They wear them because they say it\nmakes them hear better.”\n\n“Really? I don’t believe it. I think they wear them to show they are\nchamois hunters. Are there chamois near here?”\n\n“Yes, beyond the Dent de Jaman.”\n\n“It was fun seeing the fox.”\n\n“When he sleeps he wraps that tail around him to keep warm.”\n\n“It must be a lovely feeling.”\n\n“I always wanted to have a tail like that. Wouldn’t it be fun if we had\nbrushes like a fox?”\n\n“It might be very difficult dressing.”\n\n“We’d have clothes made, or live in a country where it wouldn’t make any\ndifference.”\n\n“We live in a country where nothing makes any difference. Isn’t it grand\nhow we never see any one? You don’t want to see people do you, darling?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Should we sit here just a minute? I’m a little bit tired.”"}
{"text": "We sat close together on the logs. Ahead the road went down through the\nforest.\n\n“She won’t come between us, will she? The little brat.”\n\n“No. We won’t let her.”\n\n“How are we for money?”\n\n“We have plenty. They honored the last sight draft.”\n\n“Won’t your family try and get hold of you now they know you’re in\nSwitzerland?”\n\n“Probably. I’ll write them something.”\n\n“Haven’t you written them?”\n\n“No. Only the sight draft.”\n\n“Thank God I’m not your family.”\n\n“I’ll send them a cable.”\n\n“Don’t you care anything about them?”\n\n“I did, but we quarrelled so much it wore itself out.”\n\n“I think I’d like them. I’d probably like them very much.”\n\n“Let’s not talk about them or I’ll start to worry about them.” After a\nwhile I said, “Let’s go on if you’re rested.”\n\n“I’m rested.”\n\nWe went on down the road. It was dark now and the snow squeaked under\nour boots. The night was dry and cold and very clear.\n\n“I love your beard,” Catherine said. “It’s a great success. It looks so\nstiff and fierce and it’s very soft and a great pleasure.”\n\n“Do you like it better than without?”\n\n“I think so. You know, darling, I’m not going to cut my hair now until\nafter young Catherine’s born. I look too big and matronly now. But after\nshe’s born and I’m thin again I’m going to cut it and then I’ll be a\nfine new and different girl for you. We’ll go together and get it cut,\nor I’ll go alone and come and surprise you.”\n\nI did not say anything.\n\n“You won’t say I can’t, will you?”\n\n“No. I think it would be exciting.”\n\n“Oh, you’re so sweet. And maybe I’d look lovely, darling, and be so thin\nand exciting to you and you’ll fall in love with me all over again.”\n\n“Hell,” I said, “I love you enough now. What do you want to do? Ruin\nme?”\n\n“Yes. I want to ruin you.”\n\n“Good,” I said, “that’s what I want too.”\n\nWe had a fine life. We lived through the months of January and February\nand the winter was very fine and we were very happy. There had been\nshort thaws when the wind blew warm and the snow softened and the air\nfelt like Spring, but always the clear hard cold had come again and the\nwinter had returned. In March came the first break in the winter. In the\nnight it started raining. It rained on all morning and turned the snow\nto slush and made the mountain-side dismal. There were clouds over the\nlake and over the valley. It was raining high up the mountain. Catherine\nwore heavy overshoes and I wore Mr. Guttingen’s rubber-boots and we\nwalked to the station under an umbrella, through the slush and the\nrunning water that was washing the ice of the roads bare, to stop at the\npub before lunch for a vermouth. Outside we could hear the rain.\n\n“Do you think we ought to move into town?”\n\n“What do you think?” Catherine asked.\n\n“If the winter is over and the rain keeps up it won’t be fun up here.\nHow long is it before young Catherine?”\n\n“About a month. Perhaps a little more.”\n\n“We might go down and stay in Montreux.”\n\n“Why don’t we go to Lausanne? That’s where the hospital is.”\n\n“All right. But I thought maybe that was too big a town.”\n\n“We can be as much alone in a bigger town and Lausanne might be nice.”\n\n“When should we go?”\n\n“I don’t care. Whenever you want, darling. I don’t want to leave here if\nyou don’t want.”\n\n“Let’s see how the weather turns out.”\n\nIt rained for three days. The snow was all gone now on the mountain-side\nbelow the station. The road was a torrent of muddy snow-water. It was\ntoo wet and slushy to go out. On the morning of the third day of rain we\ndecided to go down into town.\n\n“That is all right, Mr. Henry,” Guttingen said. “You do not have to give\nme any notice. I did not think you would want to stay now the bad\nweather is come.”\n\n“We have to be near the hospital anyway on account of Madame,” I said.\n\n“I understand,” he said. “Will you come back some time and stay, with\nthe little one?”\n\n“Yes, if you would have room.”\n\n“In the Spring when it is nice you could come and enjoy it. We could put\nthe little one and the nurse in the big room that is closed now and you\nand Madame could have your same room looking out over the lake.”"}
{"text": "“I’ll write about coming,” I said. We packed and left on the train that\nwent down after lunch. Mr. and Mrs. Guttingen came down to the station\nwith us and he hauled our baggage down on a sled through the slush. They\nstood beside the station in the rain waving good-by.\n\n“They were very sweet,” Catherine said.\n\n“They were fine to us.”\n\nWe took the train to Lausanne from Montreux. Looking out the window\ntoward where we had lived you could not see the mountains for the\nclouds. The train stopped in Vevey, then went on, passing the lake on\none side and on the other the wet brown fields and the bare woods and\nthe wet houses. We came into Lausanne and went into a medium-sized hotel\nto stay. It was still raining as we drove through the streets and into\nthe carriage entrance of the hotel. The concierge with brass keys on his\nlapels, the elevator, the carpets on the floors, and the white washbowls\nwith shining fixtures, the brass bed and the big comfortable bedroom all\nseemed very great luxury after the Guttingens. The windows of the room\nlooked out on a wet garden with a wall topped by an iron fence. Across\nthe street, which sloped steeply, was another hotel with a similar wall\nand garden. I looked out at the rain falling in the fountain of the\ngarden.\n\nCatherine turned on all the lights and commenced unpacking. I ordered a\nwhiskey and soda and lay on the bed and read the papers I had bought at\nthe station. It was March, 1918, and the German offensive had started in\nFrance. I drank the whiskey and soda and read while Catherine unpacked\nand moved around the room.\n\n“You know what I have to get, darling,” she said.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Baby clothes. There aren’t many people reach my time without baby\nthings.”\n\n“You can buy them.”\n\n“I know. That’s what I’ll do to-morrow. I’ll find out what is\nnecessary.”\n\n“You ought to know. You were a nurse.”\n\n“But so few of the soldiers had babies in the hospitals.”\n\n“I did.”\n\nShe hit me with the pillow and spilled the whiskey and soda.\n\n“I’ll order you another,” she said. “I’m sorry I spilled it.”\n\n“There wasn’t much left. Come on over to the bed.”\n\n“No. I have to try and make this room look like something.”\n\n“Like what?”\n\n“Like our home.”\n\n“Hang out the Allied flags.”\n\n“Oh shut up.”\n\n“Say it again.”\n\n“Shut up.”\n\n“You say it so cautiously,” I said. “As though you didn’t want to offend\nany one.”\n\n“I don’t.”\n\n“Then come over to the bed.”\n\n“All right.” She came and sat on the bed. “I know I’m no fun for you,\ndarling. I’m like a big flour-barrel.”\n\n“No you’re not. You’re beautiful and you’re sweet.”\n\n“I’m just something very ungainly that you’ve married.”\n\n“No you’re not. You’re more beautiful all the time.”\n\n“But I will be thin again, darling.”\n\n“You’re thin now.”\n\n“You’ve been drinking.”\n\n“Just whiskey and soda.”\n\n“There’s another one coming,” she said. “And then should we order dinner\nup here?”\n\n“That will be good.”\n\n“Then we won’t go out, will we? We’ll just stay in to-night.”\n\n“And play,” I said.\n\n“I’ll drink some wine,” Catherine said. “It won’t hurt me. Maybe we can\nget some of our old white capri.”\n\n“I know we can,” I said. “They’ll have Italian wines at a hotel this\nsize.”\n\nThe waiter knocked at the door. He brought the whiskey in a glass with\nice and beside the glass on a tray a small bottle of soda.\n\n“Thank you,” I said. “Put it down there. Will you please have dinner for\ntwo brought up here and two bottles of dry white capri in ice.”\n\n“Do you wish to commence your dinner with soup?”\n\n“Do you want soup, Cat?”\n\n“Please.”\n\n“Bring soup for one.”\n\n“Thank you, sir.” He went out and shut the door. I went back to the\npapers and the war in the papers and poured the soda slowly over the ice\ninto the whiskey. I would have to tell them not to put ice in the\nwhiskey. Let them bring the ice separately. That way you could tell how\nmuch whiskey there was and it would not suddenly be too thin from the\nsoda. I would get a bottle of whiskey and have them bring ice and soda.\nThat was the sensible way. Good whiskey was very pleasant. It was one of\nthe pleasant parts of life.\n\n“What are you thinking, darling?”\n\n“About whiskey.”\n\n“What about whiskey?”\n\n“About how nice it is.”\n\nCatherine made a face. “All right,” she said."}
{"text": "We stayed at that hotel three weeks. It was not bad; the dining-room was\nusually empty and very often we ate in our room at night. We walked in\nthe town and took the cogwheel railway down to Ouchy and walked beside\nthe lake. The weather became quite warm and it was like Spring. We\nwished we were back in the mountains but the Spring weather lasted only\na few days and then the cold rawness of the breaking-up of winter came\nagain.\n\nCatherine bought the things she needed for the baby, up in the town. I\nwent to a gymnasium in the arcade to box for exercise. I usually went up\nthere in the morning while Catherine stayed late in bed. On the days of\nfalse Spring it was very nice, after boxing and taking a shower, to walk\nalong the streets smelling the Spring in the air and stop at a café to\nsit and watch the people and read the paper and drink a vermouth; then\ngo down to the hotel and have lunch with Catherine. The professor at the\nboxing gymnasium wore mustaches and was very precise and jerky and went\nall to pieces if you started after him. But it was pleasant in the gym.\nThere was good air and light and I worked quite hard, skipping rope,\nshadow-boxing, doing abdominal exercises lying on the floor in a patch\nof sunlight that came through the open window, and occasionally scaring\nthe professor when we boxed. I could not shadow-box in front of the\nnarrow long mirror at first because it looked so strange to see a man\nwith a beard boxing. But finally I just thought it was funny. I wanted\nto take off the beard as soon as I started boxing but Catherine did not\nwant me to.\n\nSometimes Catherine and I went for rides out in the country in a\ncarriage. It was nice to ride when the days were pleasant and we found\ntwo good places where we could ride out to eat. Catherine could not walk\nvery far now and I loved to ride out along the country roads with her.\nWhen there was a good day we had a splendid time and we never had a bad\ntime. We knew the baby was very close now and it gave us both a feeling\nas though something were hurrying us and we could not lose any time\ntogether.\n\nOne morning I awoke about three o’clock hearing Catherine stirring in\nthe bed.\n\n“Are you all right, Cat?”\n\n“I’ve been having some pains, darling.”\n\n“Regularly?”\n\n“No, not very.”\n\n“If you have them at all regularly we’ll go to the hospital.”\n\nI was very sleepy and went back to sleep. A little while later I woke\nagain.\n\n“Maybe you’d better call up the doctor,” Catherine said. “I think maybe\nthis is it.”\n\nI went to the phone and called the doctor. “How often are the pains\ncoming?” he asked.\n\n“How often are they coming, Cat?”\n\n“I should think every quarter of an hour.”\n\n“You should go to the hospital then,” the doctor said. “I will dress and\ngo there right away myself.”\n\nI hung up and called the garage near the station to send up a taxi. No\none answered the phone for a long time. Then I finally got a man who\npromised to send up a taxi at once. Catherine was dressing. Her bag was\nall packed with the things she would need at the hospital and the baby\nthings. Outside in the hall I rang for the elevator. There was no\nanswer. I went downstairs. There was no one downstairs except the\nnight-watchman. I brought the elevator up myself, put Catherine’s bag in\nit, she stepped in and we went down. The night-watchman opened the door\nfor us and we sat outside on the stone slabs beside the stairs down to\nthe driveway and waited for the taxi. The night was clear and the stars\nwere out. Catherine was very excited.\n\n“I’m so glad it’s started,” she said. “Now in a little while it will be\nall over.”\n\n“You’re a good brave girl.”\n\n“I’m not afraid. I wish the taxi would come, though.”\n\nWe heard it coming up the street and saw its headlights. It turned into\nthe driveway and I helped Catherine in and the driver put the bag up in\nfront.\n\n“Drive to the hospital,” I said.\n\nWe went out of the driveway and started up the hill."}
{"text": "At the hospital we went in and I carried the bag. There was a woman at\nthe desk who wrote down Catherine’s name, age, address, relatives and\nreligion, in a book. She said she had no religion and the woman drew a\nline in the space after that word. She gave her name as Catherine Henry.\n\n“I will take you up to your room,” she said. We went up in an elevator.\nThe woman stopped it and we stepped out and followed her down a hall.\nCatherine held tight to my arm.\n\n“This is the room,” the woman said. “Will you please undress and get\ninto bed? Here is a nightgown for you to wear.”\n\n“I have a nightgown,” Catherine said.\n\n“It is better for you to wear this nightgown,” the woman said.\n\nI went outside and sat on a chair in the hallway.\n\n“You can come in now,” the woman said from the doorway. Catherine was\nlying in the narrow bed wearing a plain, square-cut nightgown that\nlooked as though it were made of rough sheeting. She smiled at me.\n\n“I’m having fine pains now,” she said. The woman was holding her wrist\nand timing the pains with a watch.\n\n“That was a big one,” Catherine said. I saw it on her face.\n\n“Where’s the doctor?” I asked the woman.\n\n“He’s lying down sleeping. He will be here when he is needed.”\n\n“I must do something for Madame, now,” the nurse said. “Would you please\nstep out again?”\n\nI went out into the hall. It was a bare hall with two windows and closed\ndoors all down the corridor. It smelled of hospital. I sat on the chair\nand looked at the floor and prayed for Catherine.\n\n“You can come in,” the nurse said. I went in.\n\n“Hello, darling,” Catherine said.\n\n“How is it?”\n\n“They are coming quite often now.” Her face drew up. Then she smiled.\n\n“That was a real one. Do you want to put your hand on my back again,\nnurse?”\n\n“If it helps you,” the nurse said.\n\n“You go away, darling,” Catherine said. “Go out and get something to\neat. I may do this for a long time the nurse says.”\n\n“The first labor is usually protracted,” the nurse said.\n\n“Please go out and get something to eat,” Catherine said. “I’m fine,\nreally.”\n\n“I’ll stay awhile,” I said.\n\nThe pains came quite regularly, then slackened off. Catherine was very\nexcited. When the pains were bad she called them good ones. When they\nstarted to fall off she was disappointed and ashamed.\n\n“You go out, darling,” she said. “I think you are just making me\nself-conscious.” Her face tied up. “There. That was better. I so want to\nbe a good wife and have this child without any foolishness. Please go\nand get some breakfast, darling, and then come back. I won’t miss you.\nNurse is splendid to me.”\n\n“You have plenty of time for breakfast,” the nurse said.\n\n“I’ll go then. Good-by, sweet.”\n\n“Good-by,” Catherine said, “and have a fine breakfast for me too.”\n\n“Where can I get breakfast?” I asked the nurse.\n\n“There’s a café down the street at the square,” she said. “It should be\nopen now.”\n\nOutside it was getting light. I walked down the empty street to the\ncafé. There was a light in the window. I went in and stood at the zinc\nbar and an old man served me a glass of white wine and a brioche. The\nbrioche was yesterday’s. I dipped it in the wine and then drank a glass\nof coffee.\n\n“What do you do at this hour?” the old man asked.\n\n“My wife is in labor at the hospital.”\n\n“So. I wish you good luck.”\n\n“Give me another glass of wine.”\n\nHe poured it from the bottle slopping it over a little so some ran down\non the zinc. I drank this glass, paid and went out. Outside along the\nstreet were the refuse cans from the houses waiting for the collector. A\ndog was nosing at one of the cans.\n\n“What do you want?” I asked and looked in the can to see if there was\nanything I could pull out for him; there was nothing on top but\ncoffee-grounds, dust and some dead flowers.\n\n“There isn’t anything, dog,” I said. The dog crossed the street. I went\nup the stairs in the hospital to the floor Catherine was on and down the\nhall to her room. I knocked on the door. There was no answer. I opened\nthe door; the room was empty, except for Catherine’s bag on a chair and\nher dressing-gown hanging on a hook on the wall. I went out and down the\nhall, looking for somebody. I found a nurse.\n\n“Where is Madame Henry?”\n\n“A lady has just gone to the delivery room.”"}
{"text": "“Where is it?”\n\n“I will show you.”\n\nShe took me down to the end of the hall. The door of the room was partly\nopen. I could see Catherine lying on a table, covered by a sheet. The\nnurse was on one side and the doctor stood on the other side of the\ntable beside some cylinders. The doctor held a rubber mask attached to a\ntube in one hand.\n\n“I will give you a gown and you can go in,” the nurse said. “Come in\nhere, please.”\n\nShe put a white gown on me and pinned it at the neck in back with a\nsafety pin.\n\n“Now you can go in,” she said. I went into the room.\n\n“Hello, darling,” Catherine said in a strained voice. “I’m not doing\nmuch.”\n\n“You are Mr. Henry?” the doctor asked.\n\n“Yes. How is everything going, doctor?”\n\n“Things are going very well,” the doctor said. “We came in here where it\nis easy to give gas for the pains.”\n\n“I want it now,” Catherine said. The doctor placed the rubber mask over\nher face and turned a dial and I watched Catherine breathing deeply and\nrapidly. Then she pushed the mask away. The doctor shut off the petcock.\n\n“That wasn’t a very big one. I had a very big one a while ago. The\ndoctor made me go clear out, didn’t you, doctor?” Her voice was strange.\nIt rose on the word doctor.\n\nThe doctor smiled.\n\n“I want it again,” Catherine said. She held the rubber tight to her face\nand breathed fast. I heard her moaning a little. Then she pulled the\nmask away and smiled.\n\n“That was a big one,” she said. “That was a very big one. Don’t you\nworry, darling. You go away. Go have another breakfast.”\n\n“I’ll stay,” I said.\n\nWe had gone to the hospital about three o’clock in the morning. At noon\nCatherine was still in the delivery room. The pains had slackened again.\nShe looked very tired and worn now but she was still cheerful.\n\n“I’m not any good, darling,” she said. “I’m so sorry. I thought I would\ndo it very easily. Now—there’s one—” she reached out her hand for the\nmask and held it over her face. The doctor moved the dial and watched\nher. In a little while it was over.\n\n“It wasn’t much,” Catherine said. She smiled. “I’m a fool about the gas.\nIt’s wonderful.”\n\n“We’ll get some for the home,” I said.\n\n“_There one comes_,” Catherine said quickly. The doctor turned the dial\nand looked at his watch.\n\n“What is the interval now?” I asked.\n\n“About a minute.”\n\n“Don’t you want lunch?”\n\n“I will have something pretty soon,” he said.\n\n“You must have something to eat, doctor,” Catherine said. “I’m so sorry\nI go on so long. Couldn’t my husband give me the gas?”\n\n“If you wish,” the doctor said. “You turn it to the numeral two.”\n\n“I see,” I said. There was a marker on a dial that turned with a handle.\n\n“_I want it now_,” Catherine said. She held the mask tight to her face.\nI turned the dial to number two and when Catherine put down the mask I\nturned it off. It was very good of the doctor to let me do something.\n\n“Did you do it, darling?” Catherine asked. She stroked my wrist.\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“You’re so lovely.” She was a little drunk from the gas.\n\n“I will eat from a tray in the next room,” the doctor said. “You can\ncall me any moment.” While the time passed I watched him eat, then,\nafter a while, I saw that he was lying down and smoking a cigarette.\nCatherine was getting very tired.\n\n“Do you think I’ll ever have this baby?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, of course you will.”\n\n“I try as hard as I can. I push down but it goes away. _There it comes.\nGive it to me._”\n\nAt two o’clock I went out and had lunch. There were a few men in the\ncafé sitting with coffee and glasses of kirsch or marc on the tables. I\nsat down at a table. “Can I eat?” I asked the waiter.\n\n“It is past time for lunch.”\n\n“Isn’t there anything for all hours?”\n\n“You can have _choucroute_.”\n\n“Give me _choucroute_ and beer.”\n\n“A demi or a bock?”\n\n“A light demi.”"}
{"text": "The waiter brought a dish of sauerkraut with a slice of ham over the top\nand a sausage buried in the hot wine-soaked cabbage. I ate it and drank\nthe beer. I was very hungry. I watched the people at the tables in the\ncafé. At one table they were playing cards. Two men at the table next me\nwere talking and smoking. The café was full of smoke. The zinc bar,\nwhere I had breakfasted, had three people behind it now; the old man, a\nplump woman in a black dress who sat behind a counter and kept track of\neverything served to the tables, and a boy in an apron. I wondered how\nmany children the woman had and what it had been like.\n\nWhen I was through with the _choucroute_ I went back to the hospital.\nThe street was all clean now. There were no refuse cans out. The day was\ncloudy but the sun was trying to come through. I rode upstairs in the\nelevator, stepped out and went down the hall to Catherine’s room, where\nI had left my white gown. I put it on and pinned it in back at the neck.\nI looked in the glass and saw myself looking like a fake doctor with a\nbeard. I went down the hall to the delivery room. The door was closed\nand I knocked. No one answered so I turned the handle and went in. The\ndoctor sat by Catherine. The nurse was doing something at the other end\nof the room.\n\n“Here is your husband,” the doctor said.\n\n“Oh, darling, I have the most wonderful doctor,” Catherine said in a\nvery strange voice. “He’s been telling me the most wonderful story and\nwhen the pain came too badly he put me all the way out. He’s wonderful.\nYou’re wonderful, doctor.”\n\n“You’re drunk,” I said.\n\n“I know it,” Catherine said. “But you shouldn’t say it.” Then “_Give it\nto me. Give it to me._” She clutched hold of the mask and breathed short\nand deep, pantingly, making the respirator click. Then she gave a long\nsigh and the doctor reached with his left hand and lifted away the mask.\n\n“That was a very big one,” Catherine said. Her voice was very strange.\n“I’m not going to die now, darling. I’m past where I was going to die.\nAren’t you glad?”\n\n“Don’t you get in that place again.”\n\n“I won’t. I’m not afraid of it though. I won’t die, darling.”\n\n“You will not do any such foolishness,” the doctor said. “You would not\ndie and leave your husband.”\n\n“Oh, no. I won’t die. I wouldn’t die. It’s silly to die. There it comes.\n_Give it to me._”\n\nAfter a while the doctor said, “You will go out, Mr. Henry, for a few\nmoments and I will make an examination.”\n\n“He wants to see how I am doing,” Catherine said. “You can come back\nafterward, darling, can’t he, doctor?”\n\n“Yes,” said the doctor. “I will send word when he can come back.”\n\nI went out the door and down the hall to the room where Catherine was to\nbe after the baby came. I sat in a chair there and looked at the room. I\nhad the paper in my coat that I had bought when I went out for lunch and\nI read it. It was beginning to be dark outside and I turned the light on\nto read. After a while I stopped reading and turned off the light and\nwatched it get dark outside. I wondered why the doctor did not send for\nme. Maybe it was better I was away. He probably wanted me away for a\nwhile. I looked at my watch. If he did not send for me in ten minutes I\nwould go down anyway."}
{"text": "Poor, poor dear Cat. And this was the price you paid for sleeping\ntogether. This was the end of the trap. This was what people got for\nloving each other. Thank God for gas, anyway. What must it have been\nlike before there were anæsthetics? Once it started, they were in the\nmill-race. Catherine had a good time in the time of pregnancy. It wasn’t\nbad. She was hardly ever sick. She was not awfully uncomfortable until\ntoward the last. So now they got her in the end. You never got away with\nanything. Get away hell! It would have been the same if we had been\nmarried fifty times. And what if she should die? She won’t die. People\ndon’t die in childbirth nowadays. That was what all husbands thought.\nYes, but what if she should die? She won’t die. She’s just having a bad\ntime. The initial labor is usually protracted. She’s only having a bad\ntime. Afterward we’d say what a bad time and Catherine would say it\nwasn’t really so bad. But what if she should die? She can’t die. Yes,\nbut what if she should die? She can’t, I tell you. Don’t be a fool. It’s\njust a bad time. It’s just nature giving her hell. It’s only the first\nlabor, which is almost always protracted. Yes, but what if she should\ndie? She can’t die. Why would she die? What reason is there for her to\ndie? There’s just a child that has to be born, the by-product of good\nnights in Milan. It makes trouble and is born and then you look after it\nand get fond of it maybe. But what if she should die? She won’t die. But\nwhat if she should die? She won’t. She’s all right. But what if she\nshould die? She can’t die. But what if she should die? Hey, what about\nthat? What if she should die?\n\nThe doctor came into the room.\n\n“How does it go, doctor?”\n\n“It doesn’t go,” he said.\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Just that. I made an examination—” He detailed the result of the\nexamination. “Since then I’ve waited to see. But it doesn’t go.”\n\n“What do you advise?”\n\n“There are two things. Either a high forceps delivery which can tear and\nbe quite dangerous besides being possibly bad for the child, and a\nCæsarean.”\n\n“What is the danger of a Cæsarean?” What if she should die!\n\n“It should be no greater than the danger of an ordinary delivery.”\n\n“Would you do it yourself?”\n\n“Yes. I would need possibly an hour to get things ready and to get the\npeople I would need. Perhaps a little less.”\n\n“What do you think?”\n\n“I would advise a Cæsarean operation. If it were my wife I would do a\nCæsarean.”\n\n“What are the after effects?”\n\n“There are none. There is only the scar.”\n\n“What about infection?”\n\n“The danger is not so great as in a high forceps delivery.”\n\n“What if you just went on and did nothing?”\n\n“You would have to do something eventually. Mrs. Henry is already losing\nmuch of her strength. The sooner we operate now the safer.”\n\n“Operate as soon as you can,” I said.\n\n“I will go and give the instructions.”\n\nI went into the delivery room. The nurse was with Catherine who lay on\nthe table, big under the sheet, looking very pale and tired.\n\n“Did you tell him he could do it?” she asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Isn’t that grand. Now it will be all over in an hour. I’m almost done,\ndarling. I’m going all to pieces. _Please give me that._ It doesn’t\nwork. _Oh, it doesn’t work!_”\n\n“Breathe deeply.”\n\n“I am. Oh, it doesn’t work any more. It doesn’t work!”\n\n“Get another cylinder,” I said to the nurse.\n\n“That is a new cylinder.”\n\n“I’m just a fool, darling,” Catherine said. “But it doesn’t work any\nmore.” She began to cry. “Oh, I wanted so to have this baby and not make\ntrouble, and now I’m all done and all gone to pieces and it doesn’t\nwork. Oh, darling, it doesn’t work at all. I don’t care if I die if it\nwill only stop. Oh, please, darling, please make it stop. _There it\ncomes. Oh Oh Oh!_” She breathed sobbingly in the mask. “It doesn’t work.\nIt doesn’t work. It doesn’t work. Don’t mind me, darling. Please don’t\ncry. Don’t mind me. I’m just gone all to pieces. You poor sweet. I love\nyou so and I’ll be good again. I’ll be good this time. _Can’t they give\nme something?_ If they could only give me something.”\n\n“I’ll make it work. I’ll turn it all the way.”\n\n“Give it to me now.”"}
{"text": "I turned the dial all the way and as she breathed hard and deep her hand\nrelaxed on the mask. I shut off the gas and lifted the mask. She came\nback from a long way away.\n\n“That was lovely, darling. Oh, you’re so good to me.\n\n“You be brave, because I can’t do that all the time. It might kill you.”\n\n“I’m not brave any more, darling. I’m all broken. They’ve broken me. I\nknow it now.”\n\n“Everybody is that way.”\n\n“But it’s awful. They just keep it up till they break you.”\n\n“In an hour it will be over.”\n\n“Isn’t that lovely? Darling, I won’t die, will I?”\n\n“No. I promise you won’t.”\n\n“Because I don’t want to die and leave you, but I get so tired of it and\nI feel I’m going to die.”\n\n“Nonsense. Everybody feels that.”\n\n“Sometimes I know I’m going to die.”\n\n“You won’t. You can’t.”\n\n“But what if I should?”\n\n“I won’t let you.”\n\n“Give it to me quick. _Give it to me!_”\n\nThen afterward, “I won’t die. I won’t let myself die.”\n\n“Of course you won’t.”\n\n“You’ll stay with me?”\n\n“Not to watch it.”\n\n“No, just to be there.”\n\n“Sure. I’ll be there all the time.”\n\n“You’re so good to me. There, give it to me. Give me some more. _It’s\nnot working!_”\n\nI turned the dial to three and then four. I wished the doctor would come\nback. I was afraid of the numbers above two.\n\nFinally a new doctor came in with two nurses and they lifted Catherine\nonto a wheeled stretcher and we started down the hall. The stretcher\nwent rapidly down the hall and into the elevator where every one had to\ncrowd against the wall to make room; then up, then an open door and out\nof the elevator and down the hall on rubber wheels to the operating\nroom. I did not recognize the doctor with his cap and mask on. There was\nanother doctor and more nurses.\n\n“_They’ve got to give me something_,” Catherine said. “_They’ve got to\ngive me something._ Oh please, doctor, give me enough to do some good!”\n\nOne of the doctors put a mask over her face and I looked through the\ndoor and saw the bright small amphitheatre of the operating room.\n\n“You can go in the other door and sit up there,” a nurse said to me.\nThere were benches behind a rail that looked down on the white table and\nthe lights. I looked at Catherine. The mask was over her face and she\nwas quiet now. They wheeled the stretcher forward. I turned away and\nwalked down the hall. Two nurses were hurrying toward the entrance to\nthe gallery.\n\n“It’s a Cæsarean,” one said. “They’re going to do a Cæsarean.”\n\nThe other one laughed, “We’re just in time. Aren’t we lucky?” They went\nin the door that led to the gallery.\n\nAnother nurse came along. She was hurrying too.\n\n“You go right in there. Go right in,” she said.\n\n“I’m staying outside.”\n\nShe hurried in. I walked up and down the hall. I was afraid to go in. I\nlooked out the window. It was dark but in the light from the window I\ncould see it was raining. I went into a room at the far end of the hall\nand looked at the labels on bottles in a glass case. Then I came out and\nstood in the empty hall and watched the door of the operating room.\n\nA doctor came out followed by a nurse. He held something in his two\nhands that looked like a freshly skinned rabbit and hurried across the\ncorridor with it and in through another door. I went down to the door he\nhad gone into and found them in the room doing things to a new-born\nchild. The doctor held him up for me to see. He held him by the heels\nand slapped him.\n\n“Is he all right?”\n\n“He’s magnificent. He’ll weigh five kilos.”\n\nI had no feeling for him. He did not seem to have anything to do with\nme. I felt no feeling of fatherhood.\n\n“Aren’t you proud of your son?” the nurse asked. They were washing him\nand wrapping him in something. I saw the little dark face and dark hand,\nbut I did not see him move or hear him cry. The doctor was doing\nsomething to him again. He looked upset.\n\n“No,” I said. “He nearly killed his mother.”\n\n“It isn’t the little darling’s fault. Didn’t you want a boy?”"}
{"text": "“No,” I said. The doctor was busy with him. He held him up by the feet\nand slapped him. I did not wait to see it. I went out in the hall. I\ncould go in now and see. I went in the door and a little way down the\ngallery. The nurses who were sitting at the rail motioned for me to come\ndown where they were. I shook my head. I could see enough where I was.\n\nI thought Catherine was dead. She looked dead. Her face was gray, the\npart of it that I could see. Down below, under the light, the doctor was\nsewing up the great long, forcep-spread, thick-edged, wound. Another\ndoctor in a mask gave the anæsthetic. Two nurses in masks handed things.\nIt looked like a drawing of the Inquisition. I knew as I watched I could\nhave watched it all, but I was glad I hadn’t. I do not think I could\nhave watched them cut, but I watched the wound closed into a high welted\nridge with quick skilful-looking stitches like a cobbler’s, and was\nglad. When the wound was closed I went out into the hall and walked up\nand down again. After a while the doctor came out.\n\n“How is she?”\n\n“She is all right. Did you watch?”\n\nHe looked tired.\n\n“I saw you sew up. The incision looked very long.”\n\n“You thought so?”\n\n“Yes. Will that scar flatten out?”\n\n“Oh, yes.”\n\nAfter a while they brought out the wheeled stretcher and took it very\nrapidly down the hallway to the elevator. I went along beside it.\nCatherine was moaning. Downstairs they put her in the bed in her room. I\nsat in a chair at the foot of the bed. There was a nurse in the room. I\ngot up and stood by the bed. It was dark in the room. Catherine put out\nher hand, “Hello, darling,” she said. Her voice was very weak and tired.\n\n“Hello, you sweet.”\n\n“What sort of baby was it?”\n\n“Sh—don’t talk,” the nurse said.\n\n“A boy. He’s long and wide and dark.”\n\n“Is he all right?”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “He’s fine.”\n\nI saw the nurse look at me strangely.\n\n“I’m awfully tired,” Catherine said. “And I hurt like hell. Are you all\nright, darling?”\n\n“I’m fine. Don’t talk.”\n\n“You were lovely to me. Oh, darling, I hurt dreadfully. What does he\nlook like?”\n\n“He looks like a skinned rabbit with a puckered-up old-man’s face.”\n\n“You must go out,” the nurse said. “Madame Henry must not talk.”\n\n“I’ll be outside,” I said.\n\n“Go and get something to eat.”\n\n“No. I’ll be outside.” I kissed Catherine. She was very gray and weak\nand tired.\n\n“May I speak to you?” I said to the nurse. She came out in the hall with\nme. I walked a little way down the hall.\n\n“What’s the matter with the baby?” I asked.\n\n“Didn’t you know?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“He wasn’t alive.”\n\n“He was dead?”\n\n“They couldn’t start him breathing. The cord was caught around his neck\nor something.”\n\n“So he’s dead.”\n\n“Yes. It’s such a shame. He was such a fine big boy. I thought you\nknew.”\n\n“No,” I said. “You better go back in with Madame.”\n\nI sat down on the chair in front of a table where there were nurses’\nreports hung on clips at the side and looked out of the window. I could\nsee nothing but the dark and the rain falling across the light from the\nwindow. So that was it. The baby was dead. That was why the doctor\nlooked so tired. But why had they acted the way they did in the room\nwith him? They supposed he would come around and start breathing\nprobably. I had no religion but I knew he ought to have been baptized.\nBut what if he never breathed at all. He hadn’t. He had never been\nalive. Except in Catherine. I’d felt him kick there often enough. But I\nhadn’t for a week. Maybe he was choked all the time. Poor little kid. I\nwished the hell I’d been choked like that. No I didn’t. Still there\nwould not be all this dying to go through. Now Catherine would die. That\nwas what you did. You died. You did not know what it was about. You\nnever had time to learn. They threw you in and told you the rules and\nthe first time they caught you off base they killed you. Or they killed\nyou gratuitously like Aymo. Or gave you the syphilis like Rinaldo. But\nthey killed you in the end. You could count on that. Stay around and\nthey would kill you."}
{"text": "Once in camp I put a log on top of the fire and it was full of ants. As\nit commenced to burn, the ants swarmed out and went first toward the\ncentre where the fire was; then turned back and ran toward the end. When\nthere were enough on the end they fell off into the fire. Some got out,\ntheir bodies burnt and flattened, and went off not knowing where they\nwere going. But most of them went toward the fire and then back toward\nthe end and swarmed on the cool end and finally fell off into the fire.\nI remember thinking at the time that it was the end of the world and a\nsplendid chance to be a messiah and lift the log off the fire and throw\nit out where the ants could get off onto the ground. But I did not do\nanything but throw a tin cup of water on the log, so that I would have\nthe cup empty to put whiskey in before I added water to it. I think the\ncup of water on the burning log only steamed the ants.\n\nSo now I sat out in the hall and waited to hear how Catherine was. The\nnurse did not come out, so after a while I went to the door and opened\nit very softly and looked in. I could not see at first because there was\na bright light in the hall and it was dark in the room. Then I saw the\nnurse sitting by the bed and Catherine’s head on a pillow, and she all\nflat under the sheet. The nurse put her finger to her lips, then stood\nup and came to the door.\n\n“How is she?” I asked.\n\n“She’s all right,” the nurse said. “You should go and have your supper\nand then come back if you wish.”\n\nI went down the hall and then down the stairs and out the door of the\nhospital and down the dark street in the rain to the café. It was\nbrightly lighted inside and there were many people at the tables. I did\nnot see a place to sit, and a waiter came up to me and took my wet coat\nand hat and showed me a place at a table across from an elderly man who\nwas drinking beer and reading the evening paper. I sat down and asked\nthe waiter what the _plat du jour_ was.\n\n“Veal stew—but it is finished.”\n\n“What can I have to eat?”\n\n“Ham and eggs, eggs with cheese, or _choucroute_.”\n\n“I had _choucroute_ this noon,” I said.\n\n“That’s true,” he said. “That’s true. You ate _choucroute_ this noon.”\nHe was a middle-aged man with a bald top to his head and his hair\nslicked over it. He had a kind face.\n\n“What do you want? Ham and eggs or eggs with cheese?”\n\n“Ham and eggs,” I said, “and beer.”\n\n“A demi-blonde?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\n“I remembered,” he said. “You took a demi-blonde this noon.”\n\nI ate the ham and eggs and drank the beer. The ham and eggs were in a\nround dish—the ham underneath and the eggs on top. It was very hot and\nat the first mouthful I had to take a drink of beer to cool my mouth. I\nwas hungry and I asked the waiter for another order. I drank several\nglasses of beer. I was not thinking at all but read the paper of the man\nopposite me. It was about the break through on the British front. When\nhe realized I was reading the back of his paper he folded it over. I\nthought of asking the waiter for a paper, but I could not concentrate.\nIt was hot in the café and the air was bad. Many of the people at the\ntables knew one another. There were several card games going on. The\nwaiters were busy bringing drinks from the bar to the tables. Two men\ncame in and could find no place to sit. They stood opposite the table\nwhere I was. I ordered another beer. I was not ready to leave yet. It\nwas too soon to go back to the hospital. I tried not to think and to be\nperfectly calm. The men stood around but no one was leaving, so they\nwent out. I drank another beer. There was quite a pile of saucers now on\nthe table in front of me. The man opposite me had taken off his\nspectacles, put them away in a case, folded his paper and put it in his\npocket and now sat holding his liqueur glass and looking out at the\nroom. Suddenly I knew I had to get back. I called the waiter, paid the\nreckoning, got into my coat, put on my hat and started out the door. I\nwalked through the rain up to the hospital.\n\nUpstairs I met the nurse coming down the hall.\n\n“I just called you at the hotel,” she said. Something dropped inside me.\n\n“What is wrong?”"}
{"text": "“Mrs. Henry has had a hemorrhage.”\n\n“Can I go in?”\n\n“No, not yet. The doctor is with her.”\n\n“Is it dangerous?”\n\n“It is very dangerous.” The nurse went into the room and shut the door.\nI sat outside in the hall. Everything was gone inside of me. I did not\nthink. I could not think. I knew she was going to die and I prayed that\nshe would not. Don’t let her die. Oh, God, please don’t let her die.\nI’ll do anything for you if you won’t let her die. Please, please,\nplease, dear God, don’t let her die. Dear God, don’t let her die.\nPlease, please, please don’t let her die. God please make her not die.\nI’ll do anything you say if you don’t let her die. You took the baby but\ndon’t let her die. That was all right but don’t let her die. Please,\nplease, dear God, don’t let her die.\n\nThe nurse opened the door and motioned with her finger for me to come. I\nfollowed her into the room. Catherine did not look up when I came in. I\nwent over to the side of the bed. The doctor was standing by the bed on\nthe opposite side. Catherine looked at me and smiled. I bent down over\nthe bed and started to cry.\n\n“Poor darling,” Catherine said very softly. She looked gray.\n\n“You’re all right, Cat,” I said. “You’re going to be all right.”\n\n“I’m going to die,” she said; then waited and said, “I hate it.”\n\nI took her hand.\n\n“Don’t touch me,” she said. I let go of her hand. She smiled. “Poor\ndarling. You touch me all you want.”\n\n“You’ll be all right, Cat. I know you’ll be all right.”\n\n“I meant to write you a letter to have if anything happened, but I\ndidn’t do it.”\n\n“Do you want me to get a priest or any one to come and see you?”\n\n“Just you,” she said. Then a little later, “I’m not afraid. I just hate\nit.”\n\n“You must not talk so much,” the doctor said.\n\n“All right,” Catherine said.\n\n“Do you want me to do anything, Cat? Can I get you anything?”\n\nCatherine smiled, “No.” Then a little later, “You won’t do our things\nwith another girl, or say the same things, will you?”\n\n“Never.”\n\n“I want you to have girls, though.”\n\n“I don’t want them.”\n\n“You are talking too much,” the doctor said. “Mr. Henry must go out. He\ncan come back again later. You are not going to die. You must not be\nsilly.”\n\n“All right,” Catherine said. “I’ll come and stay with you nights,” she\nsaid. It was very hard for her to talk.\n\n“Please go out of the room,” the doctor said. “You cannot talk.”\nCatherine winked at me, her face gray. “I’ll be right outside,” I said.\n\n“Don’t worry, darling,” Catherine said. “I’m not a bit afraid. It’s just\na dirty trick.”\n\n“You dear, brave sweet.”\n\nI waited outside in the hall. I waited a long time. The nurse came to\nthe door and came over to me. “I’m afraid Mrs. Henry is very ill,” she\nsaid. “I’m afraid for her.”\n\n“Is she dead?”\n\n“No, but she is unconscious.”\n\nIt seems she had one hemorrhage after another. They couldn’t stop it. I\nwent into the room and stayed with Catherine until she died. She was\nunconscious all the time, and it did not take her very long to die.\n\nOutside the room, in the hall, I spoke to the doctor, “is there anything\nI can do to-night?”\n\n“No. There is nothing to do. Can I take you to your hotel?”\n\n“No, thank you. I am going to stay here a while.”\n\n“I know there is nothing to say. I cannot tell you——”\n\n“No,” I said. “There’s nothing to say.”\n\n“Good-night,” he said. “I cannot take you to your hotel?”\n\n“No, thank you.”\n\n“It was the only thing to do,” he said. “The operation proved——”\n\n“I do not want to talk about it,” I said.\n\n“I would like to take you to your hotel.”\n\n“No, thank you.”\n\nHe went down the hall. I went to the door of the room.\n\n“You can’t come in now,” one of the nurses said.\n\n“Yes I can,” I said.\n\n“You can’t come in yet.”\n\n“You get out,” I said. “The other one too.”\n\nBut after I had got them out and shut the door and turned off the light\nit wasn’t any good. It was like saying good-by to a statue. After a\nwhile I went out and left the hospital and walked back to the hotel in\nthe rain.\n\nMisspelled words and printer errors have been corrected.
